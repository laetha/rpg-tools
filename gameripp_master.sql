(16, 'Faction Agent', 'Insight', 'Description \nMany organizations active in the North and across the face of FaerÃ»n aren\'t bound by strictures of geography. These factions pursue their agendas without regard for political boundaries, and their members operate anywhere the organization deems necessary. These groups employ listeners, rumormongers, smugglers, sellswords, cache-holders (people who guard caches of wealth or magic for use by the faction\'s operatives), haven keepers, and message drop minders, to name a few. At the core of every faction are those who don\'t merely fulfill a small function for that organization, but who serve as its hands, head, and heart. \n	As a prelude to your adventuring career (and in preparation for it), you served as an agent of a particular faction in FaerÃ»n. You might have operated openly or secretly, depending on the faction and its goals, as well as how those goals mesh with your own. Becoming an adventurer doesn\'t necessarily require you to relinquish membership in your faction (though you can choose to do so), and it might enhance your status in the faction\n\nFactions of the Sword Coast \nThe lack of large, centralized governments in the North and along the Sword Coast is likely directly responsible for the proliferation of secret societies and conspiracies in those lands. If your background is as an agent for one of the main factions of the North and Sword Coast, here are some possibilities. \n\nThe Harpers: Founded more than a millennium ago, disbanded and reorganized several times, the Harpers remain a powerful, behind-the-scenes agency, which acts to thwart evil and promote fairness through knowledge, rather than brute force. Harper agents are often proficient in Investigation, enabling them to be adept at snooping and spying. They often seek aid from other Harpers, sympathetic bards and innkeepers, rangers, and the clergy of gods that are aligned with the Harpers\' ideals. \n\nThe Order of the Gauntlet: One of the newest power groups in FaerÃ»n, the Order of the Gauntlet has an agenda similar to that of the Harpers. Its methods are vastly different, however: bearers of the gauntlet are holy warriors on a righteous quest to crush evil and promote justice, and they never hide in the shadows. Order agents tend to be proficient in Religion, and frequently seek aid from law enforcement friendly to the order\'s ideals, and the clergy of the order\'s patron gods. \n\nThe Emerald Enclave: Maintaining balance in the natural order and combating the forces that threaten that balance is the twofold goal of the Emerald Enclave. Those who serve the faction are masters of survival and living off the land. They are often proficient in Nature, and can seek assistance from woodsmen, hunters, rangers, barbarian tribes, druid circles, and priests who revere the gods of nature. \n\nThe Lords\' Alliance: On one level, the agents of the Lords\' Alliance are representatives of the cities and other governments that constitute the alliance. But, as a faction with interests and concerns that transcend local politics and geography, the Alliance has its own cadre of individuals who work on behalf of the organizations, wider agenda. Alliance agents are required to be knowledgeable in History, and can always rely on the aid of the governments that are part of the Alliance, plus other leaders and groups who uphold the Alliance\'s ideals. \n\nThe Zhentarim: In recent years, the Zhentarim have become more visible in the world at large, as the group works to improve its reputation among the common people. The faction draws employees and associates from many walks of life, setting them to tasks that serve the goals of the Black Network but aren\'t necessarily criminal in nature. Agents of the Black Network must often work in secret, and are frequently proficient in Deception. They seek aid from the wizards, mercenaries, merchants and priesthoods allied with the Zhentarim.\n\nSuggested Characteristics \nUse the tables for the acolyte background in the Player\'s Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a faction agent. (For instance, consider the words \"faith\" and \"faction\" to be interchangeable.) \n\nYour bond might be associated with other members of your faction, or a location or an object that is important to your faction. The ideal you strive for is probably in keeping with the tenets and principles of your faction, but might be more personal in nature.\n\nStarting Proficiencies \nYour background grants you the following proficiencies.\n\nSkills: Insight and one Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma skill of your choice, as appropriate to your faction\n\nLanguages: any two of your choice\n\nTools: none\n\nSafe Haven \nAs a faction agent, you have access to a secret network of supporters and operatives who can provide assistance on your adventures. You know a set of secret signs and passwords you can use to identify such operatives, who can provide you with access to a hidden safe house, free room and board, or assistance in finding information.

(17, 'Far Traveler', 'Insight, Perception', 'Description \nAlmost all of the common people and other folk that one might encounter along the Sword Coast or in the North have one thing in common: they live out their lives without ever traveling more than a few miles from where they were born. \n	You aren\'t one of those folk. \n	You are from a distant place, one so remote that few of the common folk in the North realize that it exists, and chances are good that even if some people you meet have heard of your homeland, they know merely the name and perhaps a few outrageous stories. You have come to this part of FaerÃ»n for your own reasons, which you might or might not choose to share. \n	Although you will undoubtedly find some of this land\'s ways to be strange and discomfiting, you can also be sure that some things its people take for granted will be to you new wonders that you\'ve never laid eyes on before. By the same token, you\'re a person of interest, for good or ill, to those around you almost anywhere you go.\n\nWhy Are You Here? \nA far traveler might have set out on a journey for one of a number of reasons, and the departure from his or her homeland could have been voluntary or involuntary. To determine why you are so far from home, roll 1d6 or choose from the options provided. The following section, discussing possible homelands, includes some suggested reasons that are appropriate for each location. \n\n1. Emissary \n2. Exile \n3. Fugitive \n4. Pilgrim \n5. Sightseer \n6. Wanderer\n\nWhere Are You From? \nThe most important decision in creating a far traveler background is determining your homeland. The places discussed here are all sufficiently distant from the North and the Sword Coast to justify the use of this background. \n\nEvermeet: The fabled elven is lands far to the west are home to elves who have never been to FaerÃ»n. They often find it a harsher place than they expected when they do make the trip. If you are an elf, Evermeet is a logical (though not mandatory) choice for your homeland. \n\nMost of those who emigrate from Evermeet are either exiles, forced out for committing some infraction of elven law, or emissaries who come to FaerÃ»n for a purpose that benefits elven culture or society. \n\nHalruaa: Located on the southern edges of the Shining South, and hemmed in by mountains all around, the magocracy of Halruaa is a bizarre land to most in FaerÃ»n who know about it. Many folk have heard of the strange skyships the Halruaans sail, and a few know of the tales that even the least of their people can work magic. \n\nHalruaans usually make their journeys into FaerÃ»n for personal reasons, since their government has a strict stance against unauthorized involvement with other nations and organizations. You might have been exiled for breaking one of Halruaa\'s many byzantine laws, or you could be a pilgrim who seeks the shrines of the gods of magic. \n\nKara-Tur: The continent of Kara-Tur, far to the east of Faen1n, is home to people whose customs are unfamiliar to the folk of the Sword Coast. If you come from Kara-Tur, the people of FaerÃ»n likely refer to you as Shou, even if that isn\'t your true ethnicity, because that\'s the blanket term they use for everyone who shares your origin. \n\nThe folk of Kara-Tur occasionally travel to FaerÃ»n as diplomats or to forge trade relations with prosperous merchant cartels. You might have come here as part of some such delegation, then decided to stay when the mission was over. \n\nMulhorand: From the terrain to the architecture to the god-kings who rule over these lands, nearly everything about Mulhorand is a lien to someone from the Sword Coast. You likely experienced the same sort of culture shock when you left your desert home and traveled to the unfamiliar climes of northern FaerÃ»n. Recent events in your homeland have led to the abolition of slavery, and a corresponding increase in the traffic between Mulhorand and the distant parts of FaerÃ»n. \n\nThose who leave behind Mulhorand\'s sweltering deserts and ancient pyramids for a glimpse at a different life do so for many reasons. You might be in the North simply to see the strangeness this wet land has to offer, or because you have made too many enemies among the desert communities of your home. \n\nSossal: Few have heard of your homeland, but many have questions about it upon seeing you. Humans from Sossal seem crafted from snow, with alabaster skin and white hair, and typically dressed in white. \n\nSossal exists far to the northeast, hard up against the endless ice to the north and bounded on its other sides by hundreds of miles of the Great Glacier and the Great Ice Sea. No one from your nation makes the effort to cross such colossal barriers without a convincing reason. You must fear something truly terrible or seek something incredibly important. \n\nZakhara: As the saying goes among those in FaerÃ»n who know of the place, \"To get to Zakhara, go south. Then go south some more.\" Of course, you followed an equally long route when you came north from your place of birth. Though it isn\'t unusual for Zakharans to visit the southern extremes of FaerÃ»n for trading purposes, few of them stray as far from home as you have. \n\nYou might be traveling to discover what wonders are to be found outside the deserts and sword-like mountains of your homeland, or perhaps you are on a pilgrimage to understand the gods that others worship, so that you might better appreciate your own deities. \n\nThe Underdark: Though your home is physically closer to the Sword Coast than the other locations discussed here, it is far more unnatural. You hail from one of the settlements in the Underdark, each of which has its own strange customs and laws. If you are a native of one of the great subterranean cities or settlements, you are probably a member of the race that occupies the place but you might also have grown up there after being captured and brought below when you were a child. \n\nIf you are a true Underdark native, you might have come to the surface as an emissary of your people, or perhaps to escape accusations of criminal behavior (whether warranted or not). If you aren\'t a native, your reason for leaving \"home\" probably has something to do with getting away from a bad situation.\n\nStarting Proficiencies \nYour background grants you the following proficiencies.\n\nSkills: Insight, Perception\n\nLanguages: any one of your choice\n\nTools: any one musical instrument or gaming set of your choice, likely something native to your homeland\n\nAll Eyes on You \nYour accent, mannerisms, figures of speech, and perhaps even your appearance all mark you as foreign. Curious glances are directed your way wherever you go, which can be a nuisance, but you also gain the friendly interest of scholars and others intrigued by far-off lands, to say nothing of everyday folk who are eager to hear stories of your homeland.\n	You can parley this attention into access to people and places you might not otherwise have, for you and your traveling companions.

(32, 'Knight of the Order', 'Persuasion', 'Description \nYou belong to an order of knights who have sworn oaths to achieve a certain goal. The nature of this goal depends on the order you serve, but in your eyes it is without question a vital and honorable endeavor. FaerÃ»n has a wide variety of knightly orders, all of which have a similar outlook concerning their actions and responsibilities. Though the term \"knight\" conjures ideas of mounted, heavily armored warriors of noble blood, most knightly orders in FaerÃ»n don\'t restrict their membership to such individuals. The goals and philosophies of the order are more important than the gear and fighting style of its members, and so most of these orders aren\'t limited to fighting types, but are open to all sorts of folk who are willing to battle and die for the order\'s cause. \n\nKnightly Orders of FaerÃ»n \nMany who rightfully call themselves \"knight\" earn that title as part of an order in service to a deity, such as Kelemvor\'s Eternal Order or Mystra\'s Knights of the Mystic Fire. Other knightly orders serve a government, royal family, or are the elite military of a feudal state, such as the brutal Warlock Knights ofVaasa. Other knighthoods are secular and nongovernmental organizations of warriors who follow a particular philosophy, or consider themselves a kind of extended family, similar to an order of monks. Although there are organizations, such as the Knights of the Shield, that use the trappings of knighthood without necessarily being warriors, most folk of FaerÃ»n who hear the word \"knight\" think of a mounted warrior in armor beholden to a code. Below are a few knightly organizations. \n\nKnights of the Unicorn: The Knights of the Unicorn began as a fad of romantically minded sons and daughters of patriar families in Baldur\'s Gate. On a lark, they took the unicorn goddess Lurue as their mascot and went on various adventures for fun. The reality of the dangers they faced eventually sank in, as did Lurue\'s tenets. Over time the small group grew and spread, gaining a following in places as far as Cormyr. The Knights of the Unicorn are chivalric adventurers who follow romantic ideals: life is to be relished and lived with laughter, quests should be taken on a dare, impossible dreams should be pursued for the sheer wonder of their completion, and everyone should be praised for their strengths and comforted in their weaknesses. \n\nKnights of Myth Drannor: Long ago, the Knights of Myth Drannor were a famous adventuring band, and Dove Falcon hand, one of the famous Seven Sisters, was one of them. The band took its name to honor the great but fallen city, just as the new Knights of Myth Drannor do today. With the city once again in ruins, Dove Falconhand decided to reform the group with the primary goal of building alliances and friendship between the civilized races of the world and goodly people in order to combat evil. The Knights of Myth Drannor once again ride the roads of the Dalelands, and they\'ve begun to spread to the lands beyond. Their members, each accepted by Dove herself, are above all valiant and honest. \n\nKnights of the Silver Chalice: The Knights of the Silver Chalice was formed by edict of the demigod Siamorphe in Waterdeep a century ago. Siamorphe\'s ethos is the nobility\'s right and responsibility to rule, and the demigod is incarnated as a different noble mortal in each generation. By the decree of the Siamorphe at that time, the Knights of the Silver Chalice took it upon themselves to put a proper heir on the throne of Tethyr and reestablish order in that kingdom. Since then they have grown to be the most popular knighthood in Tethyr, a nation that has hosted many knighthoods in fealty to the crown.\n\nSuggested Characteristics \nUse the tables for the soldier background in the Player\'s Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a knight of your order. \n\nYour bond almost always involves the order to which you belong (or at least key members of it), and it is highly unusual for a knight\'s ideal not to reflect the agenda, sentiment, or philosophy of one\'s order.\n\nStarting Proficiencies \nYour background grants you the following proficiencies.\n\nSkills: Persuasion, plus one from among Arcana, History, Nature, and Religion, as appropriate for your order\n\nLanguages: any one of your choice\n\nTools: your choice of a gaming set or a musical instrument\n\nKnightly Regard \nYour receive shelter and succor from members of your knightly order and those who are sympathetic to its aims. If your order is a religious one, you can gain aid from temples and other religious communities of your deity. Knights of civic orders can get help from the community â€” whether a lone settlement or a great nation â€” that they serve, and knights of philosophical orders can find help from those they have aided in pursuit of their ideals, and those who share their ideals.\n	This help comes in the form of shelter and meals, and healing when appropriate, as well as occasionally risky assistance, such as a band of local citizens rallying to aid a sorely pressed knight, or those who support the order helping to smuggle a knight out of town when he or she is being hunted unjustly.\n\nSource: Sword Coast Adventurer\'s Guide, p. 151\n\nEquipment \nOne set of traveler\'s clothes, a signet, banner, or seal representing your place or rank in the order, and a pouch containing 10 gp.\n\nPersonality Trait \nChoose or randomly determine\n\n\n1.

(33, 'Mercenary Veteran', 'Athletics, Persuasion', 'Description \nAs a sell-sword who fought battles for coin, you\'re well acquainted with risking life and limb for a chance at a share of treasure. Now, you look forward to fighting foes and reaping even greater rewards as an adventurer. Your experience makes you familiar with the ins and outs of mercenary life, and you likely have harrowing stories of events on the battlefield. You might have served with a large outfit such as the Zhentarim or the soldiers of Mintarn, or a smaller band of sell-swords, maybe even more than one.  \n	Now you\'re looking for something else, perhaps greater reward for the risks you take, or the freedom to choose your own activities. For whatever reason, you\'re leaving behind the life of a soldier for hire, but your skills are undeniably suited for battle, so now you fight on in a different way.\n\nMercenaries of the North \nCountless mercenary companies operate up and down the Sword Coast and throughout the North. Most are smallscale operations that employ a dozen to a hundred folk who offer security services, hunt monsters and brigands, or go to war in exchange for gold. Some organizations, such as the Zhentarim, Flaming Fist, and the nation of Mintarn have hundreds or thousands of members and can provide private armies to those with enough funds. A few organizations operating in the North are described below. \n\nThe Chill: The cold and mysterious Lurkwood serves as the home of numerous groups of goblinoids that have banded together into one tribe ca ll ed the Chill. Unlike most of their kind, the Chill refrains from raiding the people of the North and maintains relatively good relations so that they can hire themselves out as warriors. Few citystates in the North are willing to fi eld an army alongside the Chill, but several are happy to quietly pay the Chill to battle the Uthgardt, orcs, trolls of the Evermoors, and other threats to civilization. \n\nSilent Rain: Consisting solely of elves, Silent Rain is a legendary mercenary company operating out of Evereska. Caring little for gold or fame, Silent Rain agrees only to jobs that either promote elven causes or involve destroying orcs, gnolls, and the like. Prospective employers must leave written word (in Elvish) near Evereska, and the Silent Rain sends a representative if interested. \n\nThe Bloodaxes: Founded in Sundabar nearly two centuries ago, the Bloodaxes were originally a group of dwarves outcast from their clans for crimes against the teachings of Moradin Soulforger. They began hiring out as mercenaries to whoever in the North would pay them. Since then the mercenary company has broadened its membership to other races, but every member is an exile, criminal, or misfit of some sort looking for a fresh start and a new family among the bold Bloodaxes.\n\nStarting Proficiencies \nYour background grants you the following proficiencies.\n\nSkills: Athletics, Persuasion\n\nLanguages: none\n\nTools: one type of gaming set, land vehicles\n\nMercenary Life \nYou know the mercenary life as only someone who has experienced it can.

Or you could be an honest, hard-working landowner who cares deeply about the people who live and work on your land, keenly aware of your responsibility to them.\n	Work with your DM to come up with an appropriate title and determine how much authority that title carries. A noble title doesn\'t stand on its own â€” it\'s connected to an entire family, and whatever title you hold, you will pass it down to your own children. Not only do you need to determine your noble title, but you should also work with the DM to describe your family and their influence on you. \n	Is your family old and established, or was your title only recently bestowed? How much influence do they wield, and over what area? What kind of reputation does your family have among the other aristocrats of the region? How do the common people regard them? What\'s your position in the family? Are you the heir to the head of the family? Have you already inherited the title? How do you feel about that responsibility? Or are you so far down the line of inheritance that no one cares what you do, as long as you don\'t embarrass the family? How does the head of your family feel about your adventuring career?

Tradition and taboo have kept the Uthgardt strong while the kingdoms of others have collapsed into chaos and ruin.

Your ideal depends to some extent on how you view your role in the family, and how you intend to conduct yourself in the world at large as a representative of your house.\n\nStarting Proficiencies \nYour background grants you the following proficiencies.\n\nSkills: History, Persuasion\n\nLanguages: any one of your choice\n\nTools: one type of gaming set or one musical instrument\n\nKept in Style \nWhile you are in Waterdeep or elsewhere in the North, your house sees to your everyday needs. Your name and signet are sufficient to cover most of your expenses; the inns, taverns, and festhalls you frequent are glad to record your debt and send an accounting to your family\'s estate in Waterdeep to settle what you owe.\n	This advantage enables you to live a comfortable lifestyle without having to pay 2 gp a day for it, or reduces the cost of a wealthy or aristocratic lifestyle by that amount. You may not maintain a less affluent lifestyle and use the difference as income â€” the benefit is a line of credit, not an actual monetary reward.\n\nSource: Sword Coast Adventurer\'s Guide, p. 154\n\nEquipment \nA set of fine clothes, a signet ring or brooch, a scroll of pedigree, a skin of fine zzar or wine, and a purse containing 20 gp.\n\nPersonality Trait \nChoose or randomly determine\n\n\n1. My eloquent flattery makes everyone I talk to feel like the most wonderful and important person in the world. \n\n2. The common folk love me for my kindness and generosity. \n\n3. No one could doubt by looking at my regal bearing that I am a cut above the unwashed masses. \n\n4. I take great pains to always look my best and follow the latest fashions. \n\n5. I don\'t like to get my hands dirty, and I won\'t be caught dead in unsuitable accommodations. \n\n6. Despite my noble birth, I do not place myself above other folk. We all have the same blood. \n\n7. My favor, once lost, is lost forever. \n\n8. If you do me an injury, I will crush you, ruin your name, and salt your fields.\n\nIdeal \nChoose or randomly determine\n\n\n1. Respect: Respect is due to me because of my position, but all people regardless of station deserve to be treated with dignity. (Good). \n\n2. Responsibility: It is my duty to respect the authority of those above me, just as those below me must respect mine. (Lawful). \n\n3. Independence: I must prove that I can handle myself without the coddling of my family. (Chaotic). \n\n4. Power: If I can attain more power, no one will tell me what to do. (Evil). \n\n5. Family: Blood runs thicker than water. (Any). \n\n6. Noble Obligation: It is my duty to protect and care for the people beneath me. (Good).\n\nBond \nChoose or randomly determine\n\n\n1. I will face any challenge to win the approval of my family. \n\n2. My house\'s alliance with another noble family must be sustained at all costs. \n\n3. Nothing is more important than the other members of my family. \n\n4. I am in love with the heir of a family that my family despises. \n\n5. My loyalty to my sovereign is unwavering. \n\n6. The common folk must see me as a hero of the people.\n\nFlaw \nChoose or randomly determine\n\n\n1. I secretly believe that everyone is beneath me. \n\n2. I hide a truly scandalous secret that could ruin my family forever. \n\n3. I too often hear veiled insults and threats in every word addressed to me, and I\'m quick to anger. \n\n4. I have an insatiable desire for carnal pleasures. \n\n5. In fact, the world does revolve around me. \n\n6. By my words and actions, I often bring shame to my family.\n\n');

There is the Inn, literally just called The Junction Hotel. With limited space available, The Junction Hotel is often prohibitively expensive for most visitors and only plays host to the most wealthy nobles and highly regarded diplomats. Other than that, there is \"The Court\", a circular outdoor arena in the middle of town where major meetings take place. The Court is overseen by an elderly Halfling named Zigmi Rumblestride, known simply as \"The Scribe\". Finally, for anyone who doesn\'t stay at the inn, there\'s a small tent-city that encircles most of the area. With the lack of shops and markets in the town, the tent city becomes a bustling flurry of impromptu trade.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Junction is where most large-scale agreements between the people of the region are negotiated and decided.

As such, while there are libraries in Flintspark, the main attraction and source of knowledge comes from the Blackbox Lyceum. The Lyceum is an amazing place where inventors or enchanters will experiement/demonstrate (often for the first time) their creations in front of an audience of esteemed members of the community.

A silver piece buys a laborer\'s work for a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night\'s rest in a poor inn. \n\n	One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk. \n\n	In addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions. An electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces. \n\n	A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound. \n\n \n\nSource: Player\'s Handbook p. 143', '', '', '0.02', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', ''),

(427, 'Axe of the Dwarvish Lords', 'M', 'Seeing the peril his people faced, a young dwarf prince came to believe that his people needed something to unite them. Thus, he set out to forge a weapon that would be such a symbol.  \n\n	Venturing deep under the mountains, deeper than any dwarf had ever delved, the young prince came to the blazing heart of a great volcano. With the aid of Moradin, the dwarven god of creation, he first crafted four great tools: the Brutal Pick, the Earthheart Forge, the Anvil of Songs, and the Shaping Hammer. With them, he forged the Axe of the Dwarvish Lords.  \n\n	Armed with the artifact, the prince returned to the dwarf clans and brought peace. His axe ended grudges and answered slights. The clans became allies, and they threw back their enemies and enjoyed an era of prosperity. This young dwarf is remembered as the First King. When he became old, he passed the weapon, which had become his badge of office, to his heir. The rightful inheritors passed the axe on for many generations.  \n\n	Later, in a dark era marked by treachery and wickedness, the axe was lost in a bloody civil war fomented by greed for its power and the status it bestowed. Centuries later, the dwarves still search for the axe, and many adventurers have made careers of chasing after rumors and plundering old vaults to find it.  \n\n \n\nMagic Weapon: The Axe of the Dwarvish Lords is a magic weapon that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The axe also functions as a belt of dwarvenkind, a dwarven thrower, and a sword of sharpness.  \n\n \n\nRandom Properties: The axe has the following randomly determined properties:  \n\n	â€¢ 2 minor beneficial properties  \n\n	â€¢ 1 major beneficial property  \n\n	â€¢ 2 minor detrimental properties  \n\n \n\nBlessings of Moradin: If you are a dwarf attuned to the axe, you gain the following benefits:  \n\n \n\nâ€¢ You have immunity to poison damage.  \n\n \n\nâ€¢ The range of your darkvision increases by 60 feet.  \n\n \n\nâ€¢ You gain proficiency with artisan\'s tools related to blacksmithing, brewing, and stonemasonry.  \n\n \n\nConjure Earth Elemental: If you are holding the axe, you can use your action to cast the conjure elemental spell from it, summoning an earth elemental. You can\'t use this property again until the next dawn.  \n\n \n\nTravel the Depths: You can use an action to touch the axe to a fixed piece of dwarven stonework and cast the teleport spell from the axe. If your intended destination is underground, there is no chance of a mishap or arriving somewhere unexpected. You can\'t use this property again until 3 days have passed. \n\n \n\nCurse: The axe bears a curse that affects any non-dwarf that becomes attuned to it. Even if the attunement ends, the curse remains. With each passing day, the creature\'s physical appearance and stature become more dwarflike. After seven days, the creature looks like a typical dwarf, but the creature neither loses its racial traits nor gains the racial traits of a dwarf. The physical changes wrought by the axe aren\'t considered magical in nature (and therefore can\'t be dispelled), but they can be undone by any effect that removes a curse, such as a greater restoration or remove curse spell.  \n\n \n\nDestroying the Axe: The only way to destroy the axe is to melt it down in the Earthheart Forge, where it was created. It must remain in the burning forge for fifty years before it finally succumbs to the fire and is consumed. \n\n \n\nRange: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon\'s normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon\'s maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can\'t attack a target beyond the weapon\'s long range. \n\n \n\nThrown: If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property. \n\n \n\nVersatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands.

(593, 'Moonblade', 'M', 'Of all the magic items created by the elves, one of the most prized and jealously guarded is a moon blade. In ancient times, nearly all elven noble houses claimed one such blade. Over the centuries, some blades have faded from the world, their magic lost as family lines have become extinct. Other blades have vanished with their bearers during great quests. Thus, only a few of these weapons remain.  \n\n	A moonblade passes down from parent to child. The sword chooses its bearer and remains bonded to that person for life. If the bearer dies, another heir can claim the blade. If no worthy heir exists, the sword lies dormant. It functions like a normal longsword until a worthy soul finds it and lays claim to its power.  \n\n	A moonblade serves only one master at a time. The attunement process requires a special ritual in the throne room of an elven regent or in a temple dedicated to the elven gods.  \n\n	A moon blade won\'t serve anyone it regards as craven, erratic, corrupt, or at odds with preserving and protecting elvenkind. If the blade rejects you, you make ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws with disadvantage for 24 hours. If the blade accepts you, you become attuned to it and a new rune appears on the blade. You remain attuned to the weapon until you die or the weapon is destroyed.  \n\n	A moonblade has one rune on its blade for each master it has served (typically 1d6+1). The first rune always grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Each rune beyond the first grants the moon blade an additional property. The DM chooses each property or determines it randomly on the Moon Blade Properties table. \n\n \n\nMOONBLADE PROPERTIES:  \n\nd100 â€” Property:  \n\n01-40 â€” Increase the bonus to attack and damage rolls by 1, to a maximum of +3. Reroll if the moonblade already has a +3 bonus. \n\n \n\n41-80 â€” The moonblade gains a randomly determined minor property (see \"Special Features\" earlier in this chapter). \n\n \n\n81-82 â€” The moonblade gains the finesse property. \n\n \n\n83-84 â€” The moonblade gains the thrown property (range 20/60 feet). \n\n \n\n85-86 â€” The moonblade functions as a defender. \n\n \n\n87-90 â€” The moon blade scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20. \n\n \n\n91-92 â€” When you hit with an attack using the moon blade, the attack an extra 1d6 slashing damage. \n\n \n\n93-94 â€” When you hit a creature of a specific type (such as dragon, fiend, or undead) with the moonblade, the target takes an extra 1d6 damage of one of these types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder. \n\n \n\n95-96 â€” You can use a bonus action to cause the moonblade to flash brightly. Each creature that can see you and is within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. This property can\'t be used again until you take a short rest while attuned to the weapon. \n\n \n\n97-98 â€” The moonblade functions as a ring of spell storing. \n\n \n\n99 â€” You can use an action to call forth an elfshadow, provided that you don\'t already have one serving you. The elfshadow appears in an unoccupied space within 120 feet of you. It uses the statistics for a shadow from the Monster Manual, except it is neutral, immune to effects that turn undead, and doesn\'t create new shadows. You control this creature, deciding how it acts and moves. It remains until it drops to 0 hit points or you dismiss it as an action. \n\n \n\n00 â€” The moonblade functions as a vorpal sword. \n\n \n\nSentience: A moon blade is a sentient neutral good weapon with an Intelligence of 12, a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 12. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.  \n\n	The weapon communicates by transmitting emotions, sending a tingling sensation through the wielder\'s hand when it wants to communicate something it has sensed. It can communicate more explicitly, through visions or dreams, when the wielder is either in a trance or asleep.  \n\n \n\nPersonality: Every moonblade seeks the advancement of elvenkind and elven ideals. Courage, loyalty, beauty, music, and life are all part of this purpose.  \n\n	The weapon is bonded to the family line it is meant to serve. Once it has bonded with an owner who shares its ideals, its loyalty is absolute.  \n\n	If a moon blade has a flaw, it is overconfidence. Once it has decided on an owner, it believes that only that person should wield it, even if the owner falls short of elven ideals. \n\n \n\nVersatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands.

(655, 'Sunsword', 'M', 'The Sunsword is a unique blade once possessed by Strahd\'s brother, Sergei von Zarovich. In its original form, it had a platinum hilt and guard, and a thin crystal blade as strong as steel. \n\n	Strahd employed a powerful wizard named Khazan to destroy the weapon after Sergei\'s death. The first part of the process required the hilt and the blade to be separated, which Khazan accomplished. While Khazan was busying himself destroying the blade, his apprentice stole the hilt and fled. Khazan later located his apprentice\'s mutilated corpse in the Svalich Woods, but the hilt was nowhere to be found. To avoid the vampire\'s wrath, Khazan told Strahd that the entire weapon had been destroyed. \n\n	The hilt, which is sentient, knows that it can never be reunited with its original crystal blade. It has, however, gained the properties of a sun blade. \n\n \n\nSentience: The Sunsword is a sentient chaotic good weapon with an Intelligence of 11, a Wisdom of 17, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and normal vision out to a range of 60 feet. The weapon communicates by transmitting emotions to the creature carrying it or wielding it. \n\n \n\nPersonality: The Sunsword\'s special purpose is to destroy Strahd, not so much because it wants to free the land of Barovia from evil but because it wants revenge for the loss of its crystal blade.

(665, 'Sword of Kas', 'M', 'When Vecna grew in power, he appointed an evil and ruthless lieutenant, Kas the Bloody Handed, to act as his bodyguard and right hand. This despicable villain served as advisor, warlord, and assassin. His successes earned him Vecna\'s admiration and a reward: a sword with as dark a pedigree as the man who would wield it.  \n\n	For a long time, Kas faithfully served the lich but as Kas\'s power grew, so did his hubris. His sword urged him to supplant Vecna, so that they could rule the lich\'s empire in Vecna\'s stead. Legend says Vecna\'s destruction came at Kas\'s hand, but Vecna also wrought his rebellious lieutenant\'s doom, leaving only Kas\'s sword behind. The world was made brighter thereby.  \n\n	The Sword of Kas is a magic, sentient longsword that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.

It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.  \n\n	The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Aquan. It can also speak with aquatic animals as if using a speak with animals spell, using telepathy to involve its wielder in the conversation.  \n\n \n\nPersonality: When it grows restless, Wave has a habit of humming tunes that vary from sea chanteys to sacred hymns of the sea gods.  \n\n	Wave zealously desires to convert mortals to the worship of one or more sea gods, or else to consign the faithless to death. Conflict arises if the wielder fails to  \n\n	further the weapon\'s objectives in the world. The trident has a nostalgic attachment to the place where it was forged, a desolate island called Thunderforge. A sea god imprisoned a family of storm giants there, and the giants forged Wave in an act of devotion to- or rebellion against-that god.  \n\n	Wave harbors a secret doubt about its own nature and purpose. For all its devotion to the sea gods, Wave fears that it was intended to bring about a particular sea god\'s demise. This destiny is something Wave might not be able to avert. \n\n \n\nRange: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon\'s normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon\'s maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can\'t attack a target beyond the weapon\'s long range. \n\n \n\nThrown: If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack.

It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.  \n\n	The weapon can speak and understand Giant and Common, and it can communicate telepathically with its wielder.  \n\n	Personality: This sword believes in freedom and allowing others to live as they see fit. It is protective of its friends, and wants to be friends with a like-minded wielder. (It takes only 1 minute for a good-aligned character to gain attunement with the sword.) Waythe is courageous to the point of foolhardiness, however, and vocally urges bold action.

(717, 'Whelm', 'M', 'Whelm is a powerful warhammer forged by dwarves and lost in the dungeon of White Plume Mountain.  \n\n	You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. At dawn the day after you first make an attack roll with Whelm, you develop a fear of being outdoors that persists as long as you remain attuned to the weapon. This causes you to have disadvantage on attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks while you can see the daytime sky.  \n\n \n\nThrown Weapon: Whelm has the thrown property, with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. When you hit with a ranged weapon attack using it, the target takes an extra 1d8 bludgeoning damage, or an extra 2d8 bludgeoning damage if the target is a giant. Each time you throw the weapon, it flies back to your hand after the attack. If you don\'t have a hand free, the weapon lands at your feet.  \n\n \n\nShock Wave: You can use an action to strike the ground with Whelm and send a shock wave out from the point of impact. Each creature of your choice on the ground within 60 feet of that point must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become stunned for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once used, this property can\'t be used again until the next dawn.  \n\n \n\nSupernatural Awareness: While you are holding the weapon, it alerts you to the location of any secret or concealed doors within 30 feet of you. In addition, you can use an action to cast detect evil and good or locate object from the weapon. Once you cast either spell, you can\'t cast it from the weapon again until the next dawn.  \n\n \n\nSentience: Whelm is a sentient lawful neutral weapon with an Intelligence of 15, a Wisdom of 12, and a Charisma of 15. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.  \n\n	The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Dwarvish. Giant, and Goblin. It shouts battle cries in Dwarvish when used in combat.  \n\n \n\nPersonality: Whelm\'s purpose is to slaughter giants and goblinoids. It also seeks to protect dwarves against all enemies. Conflict arises if the wielder fails to destroy goblins and giants or to protect dwarves. Whelm has ties to the dwarf clan that created it, variously called the Dankil or the Mightyhammer clan. It longs to be returned to that clan. It would do anything to protect those dwarves from harm. The hammer also carries a secret shame. Centuries ago, a dwarf named Ctenmiir wielded it valiantly for a time. But Ctenmiir was turned into a vampire. His will was strong enough that he bent Whelm to his evil purposes, even killing members of his own clan. \n\n \n\nRange: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property.

(982, 'Ring of Winter', 'RG', 'Artus Cimber (see appendix D) has kept this item in his possession for over a century. The Ring of Winter is a golden band that resizes to fit snugly on the finger of its wearer. A thin layer of frost coats the outside of the ring, which normal heat canâ€™t melt. The ring feels ice cold to the touch and initially numbs the hand that wears it, but this cold ceases to be felt by one who is attuned to the ring.  \n\n	The Ring of Winter is sentient and tries to take control of any creature that wears it (see â€œSentient Magic Itemsâ€ in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Masterâ€™s Guide). If it succeeds, the ring compels its wearer to cause undue harm to everyone and everything around it, in a cold-hearted attempt to incur the wrath of enemies and bring about the wearerâ€™s doom.  \n\n \n\nSentience:  \n\n	The Ring of Winter is a sentient chaotic evil item with an Intelligence of 14, a Wisdom of 14, and a Charisma of 17. The ring communicates by transmitting emotion to the creature carrying or wielding it, and it has hearing and normal vision out to a range of 60 feet. The ring craves destruction, and it likes inflicting indiscriminate harm on others.  \n\n \n\nNondetection:  \n\n	The Ring of Winter defies attempts to magically locate it. Neither the ring nor its wearer can be targeted by any divination magic or perceived through magical scrying sensors.  \n\n \n\nFrozen Time:  \n\n	As long as you wear the ring, you donâ€™t age naturally. This effect is similar to suspended animation, in that your age doesnâ€™t catch up to you once the ring is removed. The ring doesnâ€™t protect its wearer from magical or supernatural aging effects, such as the Horrifying Visage of a ghost.  \n\n \n\nCold Immunity:  \n\n	While attuned to and wearing the ring, you have immunity to cold damage and donâ€™t suffer any ill effects from extreme cold (see chapter 5 of the Dungeon Masterâ€™s Guide).  \n\n \n\nMagic:  \n\n	The Ring of Winter has 12 charges and regains all its expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the ring, you can expend the necessary number of charges to activate one of the following properties:  \n\n \n\nâ€¢ You can expend 1 charge as an action and use the ring to lower the temperature in a 120-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you can see within 300 feet of you. The temperature in that area drops 20 degrees per minute, to a minimum of â€“30 degrees Fahrenheit. Frost and ice begin to form on surfaces once the temperature drops below 32 degrees. This effect is permanent unless you use the ring to end it as an action, at which point the temperature in the area returns to normal at a rate of 10 degrees per minute.  \n\n \n\nâ€¢ You can cast one of the following spells from the ring (spell save DC 17) by expending the necessary number of charges: Bigbyâ€™s hand (2 charges; the hand is made of ice, is immune to cold damage, and deals bludgeoning damage instead of force damage as a clenched fist), cone of cold (2 charges), flesh to ice (3 charges; as flesh to stone except that the target turns to solid ice with the density and durability of stone), ice storm (2 charges), Otilukeâ€™s freezing sphere (3 charges), sleet storm (1 charge), spike growth (1 charge; the spikes are made of ice), or wall of ice (2charges).  \n\n \n\nâ€¢ You can expend the necessary number of charges as an action and use the ring to create either an inanimate ice object (2 charges) or an animated ice creature (4 charges). The ice object canâ€™t have any moving parts, must be able to fit inside a 10-foot cube, and has the density and durability of metal or stone (your choice). The ice creature must be modeled after a beast with a challenge rating of 2 or less. The ice creature has the same statistics as the beast it models, with the following changes: the creature is a construct with vulnerability to fire damage, immunity to cold and poison damage, and immunity to the following conditions: charmed, exhaustion, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, and poisoned. The ice creature obeys only its creatorâ€™s commands. The ice object or creature appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of you. It melts into a pool of normal water after 24 hours or when it drops to 0 hit points. In extreme heat, it loses 5 (1d10) hit points per minute as it melts. Use the guidelines in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Masterâ€™s Guide to determine the hit points of an inanimate object if they become necessary.  \n\n \n\nOther Properties:  \n\n	The Ring of Winter is rumored to possess other properties that can be activated only by an evil being whose will the ring canâ€™t break. Frost giants have long believed that the ring can be used to freeze entire worlds, while a djinni in the service of a Calishite pasha once claimed that the ring could be used to summon and control white dragons, as well as a mighty ice primordial named Cryonax.  \n\n \n\nDestroying the Ring:  \n\n	The ring is nigh indestructible, resisting even the most intense magical heat. If it is placed on the finger of the powerful archfey known as the Summer Queen, the ring melts away and is destroyed forever. \n\n \n\nSource: Tomb of Annihilation, p. 207', '1', 'artifact (requires attunement)', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', ''),

(1062, 'Book of Exalted Deeds', 'W', 'The definitive treatise on all that is good in the multiverse, the fabled Book of Exalted Deeds figures prominently in many religions. Rather than being a scripture devoted to a particular faith, the book\'s various authors filled the pages with their own vision of true virtue, providing guidance for defeating evil.  \n\n	The Book of Exalted Deeds rarely lingers in one place. As soon as the book is read, it vanishes to some other corner of the multiverse where its moral guidance can bring light to a darkened world. Although attempts have been made to copy the work, efforts to do so fail to capture its magical nature or translate the benefits it offers to those pure of heart and firm of purpose.  \n\n	A heavy clasp, wrought to look like angel wings,. keeps the book\'s contents secure. Only a creature of good alignment that is attuned to the book can release the clasp that holds it shut. Once the book is opened, the attuned creature must spend 80 hours reading and studying the book to digest its contents and gain its benefits. Other creatures that peruse the book\'s open pages can read the text but glean no deeper meaning and reap no benefits. An evil creature that tries to read from the book takes 24d6 radiant damage. This damage ignores resistance and immunity, and can\'t be reduced or avoided by any means. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this damage disappears in a blinding flash and is destroyed, leaving its possessions behind.  \n\n	Benefits granted by the Book of Exalted Deeds last only as long as you strive to do good. If you fail to perform at least one act of kindness or generosity within the span of 10 days, or if you willingly perform an evil act, you lose all the benefits granted by the book.  \n\n \n\nRandom Properties: The Book of Exalted Deeds has the following random properties:  \n\n	â€¢ 2 minor beneficial properties  \n\n	â€¢ 2 major beneficial properties  \n\n \n\nIncreased Wisdom: After you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book, your Wisdom score increases by 2, to a maximum of 24.

No mortal was meant to know the secrets it contains, knowledge so horrid that to even glimpse the scrawled pages invites madness.  \n\n	Most believe the lich-god Vecna authored the Book of Vile Darkness. He recorded in its pages every diseased idea, every unhinged thought, and every example of blackest magic he came across or devised. Vecna covered every vile topic he could, making the book a gruesome catalog of all mortal wrongs.  \n\n	Other practitioners of evil have held the book and added their own input to its catalog of vile knowledge. Their additions are clear, for the writers of later works stitched whatever they were writing into the tome or, in some cases, made notations and additions to existing text. There are places where pages are missing, torn. or covered so completely with ink, blood, and scratches that the original text can\'t be divined.  \n\n	Nature can\'t abide the book\'s presence. Ordinary plants wither in its presence, animals are unwilling to approach it, and the book gradually destroys whatever it touches. Even stone cracks and turns to powder if the book rests on it long enough.  \n\n	A creature attuned to the book must spend 80 hours reading and studying it to digest its contents and reap its benefits. The creature can then freely modify the book\'s contents, provided that those modifications advance evil and expand the lore already contained within.  \n\n	Whenever a non-evil creature attunes to the Book of Vile Darkness, that creature must make a DC 17 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature\'s alignment changes to neutral evil.  \n\n	The Book of Vile Darkness remains with you only as long as you strive to work evil in the world. If you fail to perform at least one evil act within the span of 10 days, or if you willingly perform a good act, the book disappears. If you die while attuned to the book, an entity of great evil claims your soul. You can\'t be restored to life by any means while your soul remains imprisoned.  \n\n \n\nRandom Properties: The Book of Vile Darkness has the following random properties:  \n\n	â€¢ 3 minor beneficial properties  \n\n	â€¢ 1 major beneficial property  \n\n	â€¢ 3 minor detrimental properties  \n\n	â€¢ 2 major detrimental properties  \n\n \n\nAdjusted Ability Scores: After you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book, one ability score of your choice increases by 2, to a maximum of 24.

The book can\'t adjust your ability scores again.  \n\n \n\nMark of Darkness: After you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book, you acquire a physical disfigurement as a hideous sign of your devotion to vile darkness. An evil rune might appear on your face, your eyes might become glossy black, or horns might sprout from your forehead. Or you might become wizened and hideous, lose all facial features, gain a forked tongue, or some other feature the DM chooses. The mark of darkness grants you advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks made to interact with evil creatures and Charisma (Intimidation) checks made to interact with non-evil creatures.  \n\n \n\nCommand Evil: While you are attuned to the book and holding it, you can use an action to cast the dominate monster spell on an evil target (save DC 18). You can\'t use this property again until the next dawn.  \n\n \n\nDark Lore: You can reference the Book of Vile Darkness whenever you make an Intelligence check to recall information about some aspect of evil, such as lore about demons. When you do so, double your proficiency bonus on that check.  \n\n \n\nDark Speech: While you carry the Book of Vile Darkness and are attuned to it, you can use an action to recite word from its pages in a foul language known as Dark Speech. Each time you do so, you take 1d12 psychic damage, and each non-evil creature within 15 feet of you takes 3d6 psychic damage.  \n\n \n\nDestroying the Book: The Book of Vile Darkness allows pages to be torn from it, but any evil lore contained on those pages finds its way back into the book eventually, usually when a new author adds pages to the tome.  \n\n	If a solar tears the book in two, the book is destroyed for 1d100 years, after which it reforms in some dark corner of the multiverse.  \n\n	A creature attuned to the book for one hundred years can unearth a phrase hidden in the original text that, when translated to Celestial and spoken aloud, destroys both the speaker and the book in a blinding flash of radiance. However, as long as evil exists in the multiverse, the book reforms 1d10 x 100 years later.  \n\n	If all evil in the multiverse is wiped out, the book turns to dust and is forever destroyed. \n\n \n\nSource: Dungeon Master\'s Guide p. 222', '1', 'artifact (requires attunement)', '5', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', ''),

(1117, 'Devastation Orb of Water', 'W', 'A devastation orb is an elemental bomb that can be created at the site of an elemental node by performing a ritual with an elemental weapon. The type of orb created depends on the node used. For example, an air node creates a devastation orb of air. The ritual takes 1 hour to complete and requires 2,000 gp worth of special components, which are consumed. \n\n	A devastation orb measures 12 inches in diameter, weighs 10 pounds, and has a solid outer shell. The orb detonates 1d100 hours after its creation, releasing the elemental energy it contains. The orb gives no outward sign of how much time remains before it will detonate. Spells such as identify and divination can be used to ascertain when the orb will explode. An orb has AC 10, 15 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Reducing it to 0 hit points causes it to explode instantly. \n\n	A special container can be crafted to contain a devastation orb and prevent it from detonating. The container must be inscribed with symbols of the orb\'s opposing element. For example, a case inscribed with earth symbols can be used to contain a devastation orb of air and keep it from detonating. While in the container, the orb thrums. If it is removed from the container after the time when it was supposed to detonate, it explodes 1d6 rounds later, unless it is returned to the container. \n\n	Regardless of the type of orb, its effect is contained within a sphere with a 1 mile radius. The orb is the sphere\'s point of origin. The orb is destroyed after one use. \n\n	Water Orb: When this orb detonates, it creates a torrential rainstorm that lasts for 24 hours. Within the area of effect, the rules for heavy precipitation apply, as detailed in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master\'s Guide. If there is a substantial body of water in the area, it floods after 2d10 hours of heavy rain, rising 10 feet above its banks and inundating the surrounding area. The flood advances at a rate of 100 feet per round, moving away from the body of water where it began until it reaches the edge of the area of effect: at that point, the water flows downhill (and possibly recedes back to its origin). Light structures collapse and wash away. Any Large or smaller creature caught in the flood\'s path is swept away. The flooding destroys crops and might trigger mudslides, depending on the terrain. \n\n \n\nSource: Princes of the Apocalypse p. 222', '1', 'very rare', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', ''),

The horn has been blasted with fire into a dark ebony hue and is wrapped in bands of bronze with draconic runes that glow with purple eldritch fire. \n\n	The low, moaning drone of the Draakhorn discomfits normal animals within a few miles, and it alerts all dragons within two thousand miles to rise and be wary, for great danger is at hand. Coded blasts were once used to signal specific messages. Knowledge of those codes has been lost to the ages. \n\n	Those with knowledge of the Draakhorn\'s history know that it was first built to signal danger to chromatic dragons â€” a purpose the Cult of the Dragon has corrupted to call chromatic dragons to the Well of Dragons from across the North. \n\n	Within 50 feet of any enclosed space where the horn is blown, the air begins to shimmer from the sound. Any character within 20 feet of the entry to the enclosed space must succeed on a DC 12 Strength check to continue pushing against the pressure of the sound. A failure indicates the character can advance no farther toward the entry. \n\n	For any character entering the enclosed space, the sound fades to silence â€” because any creature that enters the enclosed space is temporarily deafened and must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. Success indicates the deafness ends 2 minutes after the Draakhorn ceases to sound. Failure indicates the character remains deafened for 1 hour after the Draakhorn ceases to sound. \n\n	While the horn is sounding, a creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw the first time on a turn the creature enters a 150-foot cone in front of the horn or starts its turn there. On a failed save, the creature takes 27 (6d8) thunder damage and is knocked prone.

Through dark magic and conquest, he forged a terrible empire. For all his power, Vecna couldn\'t escape his own mortality. He began to fear death and take steps to prevent his end from ever coming about.  \n\n	Orcus, the demon prince of undeath, taught Vecna a ritual that would allow him to live on as a lich. Beyond death, he became the greatest of all liches. Even though his body gradually withered and decayed, Vecna continued to expand his evil dominion. So formidable and hideous was his temper that his subjects feared to speak his name. He was the Whispered One, the Master of the Spider Throne, the Undying King, and the Lord of the Rotted Tower.  \n\n	Some say that Vecna\'s lieutenant Kas coveted the Spider Throne for himself, or that the sword his lord made for him seduced him into rebellion. Whatever the reason, Kas brought the Undying King\'s rule to an end in a terrible battle that left Vecna\'s tower a heap of ash. Of Vecna, all that remained were one hand and one eye, grisly artifacts that still seek to work the Whispered One\'s will in the world.  \n\n	The Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna might be found together or separately.

The paint flows from the brush to form the desired object as you concentrate on its image. \n\n	Each pot of paint is sufficient to cover 1,000 square feet of a surface, which lets you create inanimate objects or terrain features-such as a door, a pit, flowers, trees, cells, rooms, or weapons- that are up to 10,000 cubic feet. It takes 10 minutes to cover 100 square feet. \n\n	When you complete the painting, the object or terrain feature depicted becomes a real, nonmagical object.

(1235, 'Orb of Dragonkind', 'W', 'Ages past, on the world of Krynn, elves and humans waged a terrible war against evil dragons. When the world seemed doomed, the wizards of the Towers of High Sorcery came together and worked their greatest magic, forging five Orbs of Dragonkind (or Dragon Orbs) to help them defeat the dragons. One orb was taken to each of the five towers, and there they were used to speed the war toward a victorious end. The wizards used the orbs to lure dragons to them, then destroyed the dragons with powerful magic.  \n\n	As the Towers of High Sorcery fell in later ages, the orbs were destroyed or faded into legend, and only three are thought to survive. Their magic has been warped and twisted over the centuries, so although their primary purpose of calling dragons still functions, they also allow some measure of control over dragons.  \n\n	Each orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a presence that resents any attempt to coax magic from it. Those lacking in force of personality might find themselves enslaved to an orb.  \n\n	An orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in diameter. When used, it grows to about 20 inches in diameter, and mist swirls inside it.  \n\n	While attuned to an orb, you can use an action to peer into the orb\'s depths and speak its command word. You must then make a DC 15 Charisma check. On a successful check, you control the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it. On a failed check, you become charmed by the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it.  \n\n	While you are charmed by the orb, you can\'t voluntarily end your attunement to it, and the orb casts suggestion on you at will (save DC 18), urging you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The dragon essence within the orb might want many things: the annihilation of a particular people, freedom from the orb, to spread suffering in the world, to advance the worship of Takhisis (Tiamat\'s name on Krynn), or something else the DM decides.  \n\n \n\nRandom Properties: An Orb of Dragon kind has the following random properties:  \n\n	â€¢ 2 minor beneficial properties  \n\n	â€¢ 1 minor detrimental property  \n\n	â€¢ 1 major detrimental property  \n\n \n\nSpells: The orb has 7 charges and regains 1d4+3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you control the orb, you can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: cure wounds (5th-level version, 3 charges), daylight (1 charge), death ward (2 charges), or scrying (3 charges). You can also use an action to cast the detect magic spell from the orb without using any charges.  \n\n \n\nCall Dragons: While you control the orb, you can use an action to cause the artifact to issue a telepathic call that extends in all directions for 40 miles. Evil dragons in range feel compelled to come to the orb as soon as possible by the most direct route. Dragon deities such as Tiamat are unaffected by this call. Dragons drawn to the orb might be hostile toward you for compelling them against their will.

Only a creature attuned to a Ruling Scepter and in possession of it can harness the powers of the Wyrmskull Throne, which has become the centerpiece of King Hekaton\'s throne room in the undersea citadel of Maelstrom.

The wand can magically change in size to better conform to the grip of its user. Plants wither, drinks spoil, flesh rots, and vermin thrive in the wand\'s presence.  \n\n	Any creature besides Orcus that tries to attune to the wand must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the creature takes 10d6 necrotic damage. On a failed save, the creature dies and rises as a zombie.  \n\n	In the hands of one who is attuned to it, the wand can be wielded as a magic mace that grants a+3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The wand deals an extra 2d12 necrotic damage on a hit.  \n\n \n\nRandom Properties: The Wand of Orcus has the following random properties:  \n\n	â€¢ 2 minor beneficial properties  \n\n	â€¢ 1 major beneficial property  \n\n	â€¢ 2 minor detrimental properties  \n\n	â€¢ 1 major detrimental property  \n\n	The detrimental properties of the Wand of Orcus are suppressed while the wand is attuned to Orcus himself.  \n\n \n\nProtection: You gain a +3 bonus to Armor Class while holding the wand.  \n\n \n\nSpells: The wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action and expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: animate dead (1 charge), blight (2 charges), circle of death (3 charges), finger of death (3 charges), power word kill (4 charges), or speak with dead (1 charge). The wand regains 1d4+3 expended charges daily at dawn.  \n\n	While attuned to the wand, Orcus or a follower blessed by him can cast each of the wand\'s spells using 2 fewer charges (minimum of 0).  \n\n \n\nCall Undead: While you are holding the wand, you can use an action to conjure skeletons and zombies, calling forth as many of them as you can divide 500 hit points among, each undead having average hit points (see the Monster Manual for statistics). The undead magically rise up from the ground or otherwise form in unoccupied spaces within 300 feet of you and obey your commands until they are destroyed or until dawn of the next day, when they collapse into inanimate piles of bones and rotting corpses. Once you use this property of the wand, you can\'t use it again until the next dawn.  \n\n	While attuned to the wand, Orcus can summon any kind of undead, not just skeletons and zombies. The undead don\'t perish or disappear at dawn the following day, remaining until Orcus dismisses them.  \n\n \n\nSentience: The Wand of Orcus is a sentient, chaotic evil item with an Intelligence of 16, a Wisdom of 12, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.  \n\n	The wand communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Abyssal and Common.  \n\n \n\nPersonality: The wand\'s purpose is to help satisfy Orcus\'s desire to slay everything in the multiverse. The wand is cold, cruel, nihilistic, and bereft of humor. In order to further its master\'s goals, the wand feigns devotion to its current user and makes grandiose promises that it has no intention of fulfilling, such as vowing to help its user overthrow Orcus.  \n\n \n\nDestroying the Wand: Destroying the Wand of Orcus requires that it be taken to the Positive Energy Plane by the ancient hero whose skull surmounts it. For this to happen, the long-lost hero must first be restored to life â€” no easy task, given the fact that Orcus has imprisoned the hero\'s soul and keeps it hidden and well guarded.  \n\n	Bathing the wand in positive energy causes it to crack and explode, but unless the above conditions are met, the wand instantly reforms on Orcus\'s layer of the Abyss. \n\n \n\nSource: Dungeon Master\'s Guide p. 227', '1', 'artifact (requires attunement)', '4', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', ''),

If you didn\'t target a creature, you become the target and must make the saving throw. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target is instantly petrified. On any other failed save, the target is restrained and begins to turn to stone.

Until the spell ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on you.  \n	Spells and other magical effects, except those created by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere and can\'t protrude into it. A slot expended to cast a suppressed spell is consumed.

If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed. For example, the flames created by a wall of fire are suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough.  \n	Spells: Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it.  \n	Magic Items: The properties and powers of magic items are suppressed in the sphere.

A magic weapon\'s properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere.

On a successful save, the creature is no longer affected by the target and recognizes the feeling of repugnance or attraction as magical.

If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard\'s laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory.

Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item\'s current owner.  \n	The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you.
