One died, one didn't make it back to @JournalEntry[The Gateway] on time and is stuck.

The Inner Plane at the intersection of the Planes of Earth and Water. They were swept in a mudslide immediately upon landing and had to hide in the muck as droves of mosquitoes the size of eagles swarmed by. One of their party was grabbed by a mosquito and sucked completely dry in seconds.
