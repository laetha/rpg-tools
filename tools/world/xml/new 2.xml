				<name>Martial Archetype: Gunslinger</name>
				<text>Most warriors and combat specialists spend their years perfecting the classic arts of swordplay, archery, or polearm tactics. Whether duelist or infantry, martial weapons were seemingly perfected long ago, and the true challenge is to master them. </text>
				<text>However, some minds couldn’t stop with the innovation of the crossbow. Experimentation with alchemical components and rare metals have unlocked the secrets of controlled explosive force. The few who survive these trials of ingenuity may become the first to create, and deftly wield, the first firearms.</text>
				<text>This archetype focuses on the ability to design, craft, and utilize powerful, yet dangerous ranged weapons. Through creative innovation and immaculate aim, you become a distant force of death on the battlefield. However, not being a perfect science, firearms carry an inherent instability that can occasionally leave you without a functional means of attack. This is the danger of new, untested technologies in a world where the arcane energies that rule the elements are ever present.</text>
				<text>Should this path of powder, fire, and metal call to you, keep your wits about you, hold on to your convictions as a fighter, and let skill meet luck to guide your bullets to strike true.</text>

				<name>Gunsmith (Arcane Archer)</name>

				<name>Grit (Arcane Archer)</name>
				<text>Also starting at 3rd level, you gain a number of grit points equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1). You can spend grit points to perform various “shot" attacks with your firearms. An attack can only be affected by a single shot feature. You can regain spent Grit points in the following ways:</text>
				<text>Critical hit with a firearm: Each time you score a critical hit with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, you regain 1 spent grit point. Critical hits gained outside of die rolls (via enemy conditions) do not generate grit.</text>
				<text>Killing blow with a firearm: Each time you reduce a dangerous creature (DMs discretion) to 0 hit points with a firearm attack, and kill them, you regain 1 spent grit point. You also regain all spent grit points after finishing a short or long rest.</text>

				<name>Violent Shot (Arcane Archer)</name>
				<text>Starting at 7th level, you’ve discovered ways to push your firearms past their intended potential at the peril of damaging them. You can spend 1 or more grit points before making an attack roll with a firearm. For each grit point spent, that attack gains +2 to the firearm’s misfire score. If the attack hits, you can roll one additional weapon damage die per grit point spent when determining damage of the attack.</text>
