    <monsterTrait2>Undead Nature 
An allip doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.</monsterTrait2>
    <monsterTrait3>Incorporeal Movement 
The allip can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.</monsterTrait3>
    <monsterAction1>Maddening Touch 
Melee Spell Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (4d6 + 3) psychic damage.</monsterAction1>
    <monsterAction2>Whispers of Madness 
The allip chooses up to three creatures it can see within 60 feet of it. Each target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw, or it takes 7 (1d8 + 3) psychic damage and must use its reaction to make a melee weapon attack against one creature of the allip's choice that the allip can see. Constructs and undead are immune to this effect.</monsterAction2>
    <monsterAction3>Howling Babble (Recharge 6) 
Each creature within 30 feet of the allip that can hear it must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 12 (2d8 + 3) psychic damage, and it is stunned until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't stunned. Constructs and undead are immune to this effect. 

 

Stunned: 

• A stunned creature is incapacitated, meaning it can't take actions or reactions, can't move, and can speak only falteringly. 

 

• The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws. 

 

• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.</monsterAction3>

    <monsterTrait2>Titanic Nature 
Although it eats and sleeps if it so desires, an astral dreadnought doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</monsterTrait2>
    <monsterTrait3>Antimagic Cone 
The astral dreadnought's opened eye creates an area of antimagic, as in the antimagic field spell, in a 150-foot cone. At the start of each of its turns, the dreadnought decides which way the cone faces. The cone doesn't function while the dreadnought's eye is closed or while the dreadnought is blinded.</monsterTrait3>
    <monsterTrait4>Astral Entity 
The astral dreadnought can't leave the Astral Plane, nor can it be banished or otherwise transported out of the Astral Plane.</monsterTrait4>
    <monsterTrait5>Demiplanar Donjon 
Any creature or object that the astral dreadnought swallows is transported to a demiplane that can be entered by no other means except a wish spell or this creature's Donjon Visit ability. A creature can leave the demiplane only by using magic that enables planar travel, such as the plane shift spell. The demiplane resembles a stone cave roughly 1,000 feet in diameter with a ceiling 100 feet high. Like a stomach, it contains the remains of the dreadnought's past meals. The dreadnought can't be harmed from within the demiplane. If the dreadnought dies, the demiplane disappears, and everything inside it appears around the corpse. The demiplane is otherwise indestructible.</monsterTrait5>
    <monsterTrait6>Legendary Resistance (3/Day) 
If the astral dreadnought fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.</monsterTrait6>
    <monsterTrait7>Magic Weapons 
An astral dreadnought's weapon attacks are magical.</monsterTrait7>
    <monsterTrait8>Sever Silver Cord 
If the astral dreadnought scores a critical hit against a creature traveling through the Astral Plane by means of the astral projection spell, the dreadnought can cut the target's silver cord instead of dealing damage.</monsterTrait8>
    <monsterAction1>Multiattack 
The astral dreadnought makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.</monsterAction1>
    <monsterAction2>Bite 
Melee Weapon Attack: +16 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 36 (5d10 + 9) piercing damage. If the target is a creature of Huge size or smaller and this damage reduces it to 0 hit points or it is incapacitated, the astral dreadnought swallows it. The swallowed target, along with everything it is wearing and carrying, appears in an unoccupied space on the floor of the astral dreadnought's Demiplanar Donjon.</monsterAction2>
    <monsterAction3>Claw 
Melee Weapon Attack: +16 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 19 (3d6 + 9) slashing damage.</monsterAction3>
    <monsterLegendary1>Legendary Actions (3/Turn) 
The astral dreadnought can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The dreadnought regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.</monsterLegendary1>
    <monsterLegendary2>Claw 
The astral dreadnought makes one claw attack.</monsterLegendary2>
    <monsterLegendary3>Donjon Visit (Costs 2 Actions) 
One creature that is Huge or smaller that the astral dreadnought can see within 60 feet of it must succeed on a DC 19 Charisma saving throw or be magically teleported to an unoccupied space on the floor of the astral dreadnought's Demiplanar Donjon. At the end of the target's next turn, the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.</monsterLegendary3>
    <monsterLegendary4>Psychic Projection (Costs 3 Actions) 
Each creature within 60 feet of the astral dreadnought must make a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw, taking 15 (2d10 + 4) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</monsterLegendary4>

    <monsterTrait2>Legendary Resistance (2/Day) 
If the balhannoth fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.</monsterTrait2>
    <monsterAction1>Multiattack 
The balhannoth makes a bite attack and up to two tentacle attacks, or it makes up to four tentacle attacks.</monsterAction1>
    <monsterAction2>Bite 
Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 25 (4d10 + 3) piercing damage.</monsterAction2>
    <monsterAction3>Tentacle 
Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 15) and is moved up to 5 feet toward the balhannoth. Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the balhannoth can't use this tentacle against other targets. The balhannoth has four tentacles. 

 

Grappled: 

• A grappled creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed. 

 

• The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated. 

 

• The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by the thunderwave spell. 

 

Restrained: 

• A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed. 

 

• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage. 

 

• The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.</monsterAction3>
    <monsterAction4>Lair Actions 
When fighting inside its lair, a balhannoth can use lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), a balhannoth can take one lair action to cause one of the following effects; the balhannoth can't use the same lair action two rounds in a row: 

 

• The balhannoth warps reality around it in an area up to 500 feet square. After 10 minutes, the terrain in the area reshapes to assume the appearance of a location sought by one intelligent creature whose mind the balhannoth has read (see Regional Effects below). The transformation affects nonliving material only and can't create anything with moving parts or magical properties. Any object created in this area is, upon close inspection, revealed as a fake. Books are filled with empty pages, golden items are obvious counterfeits, and so on. The transformation lasts until the balhannoth dies or uses this lair action again. 

 

• The balhannoth targets one creature within 500 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or the target, along with whatever it is wearing and carrying, teleports to an unoccupied space of the balhannoth's choice within 60 feet of it. 

 

• The balhannoth targets one creature within 500 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or the balhannoth becomes invisible to that creature for 1 minute. This effect ends if the balhannoth attacks the target. 

 

Invisible: 

• An invisible creature is impossible to see without the aid of magic or a special sense. For the purpose of hiding, the creature is heavily obscured. The creature's location can be detected by any noise it makes or any tracks it leaves. 

 

• Attack rolls against the creature have disadvantage, and the creature's attack rolls have advantage.</monsterAction4>
    <monsterLegendary1>Legendary Actions (3/Turn) 
The balhannoth can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The balhannoth regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.</monsterLegendary1>
    <monsterLegendary2>Bite Attack 
The balhannoth makes one bite attack against one creature it has grappled.</monsterLegendary2>
    <monsterLegendary3>Teleport 
The balhannoth magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying and any creatures it has grappled, up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.</monsterLegendary3>
    <monsterLegendary4>Vanish 
The balhannoth magically becomes invisible for up to 10 minutes or until immediately after it makes an attack roll.</monsterLegendary4>

    <monsterTrait2>Spectral Duplicate (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest) 
As a bonus action, the berbalang creates one spectral duplicate of itself in an unoccupied space it can see within 60 feet of it. While the duplicate exists, the berbalang is unconscious. A berbalang can have only one duplicate at a time. The duplicate disappears when it or the berbalang drops to 0 hit points or when the berbalang dismisses it (no action required). The duplicate has the same statistics and knowledge as the berbalang, and everything experienced by the duplicate is known by the berbalang. All damage dealt by the duplicate's attacks is psychic damage. 

 

Unconscious: 

• An unconscious creature is incapacitated, meaning it can't take actions or reactions, can't move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings. 

 

• The creature drops whatever it's holding and falls prone. 

 

• The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws. 

 

• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage. 

 

• Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.</monsterTrait2>

    <monsterTrait2>Undead Nature 
A boneclaw doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</monsterTrait2>
    <monsterTrait3>Rejuvenation 
While its master lives, a destroyed boneclaw gains a new body in 1d10 hours, with all its hit points. The new body appears within 1 mile of the boneclaw's master.</monsterTrait3>

If the target is a creature, the boneclaw can pull the target up to 10 feet toward itself, and the target is grappled (escape DC 14). The boneclaw has two claws. While a claw grapples a target, the claw can attack only that target. 

 

Grappled: 

• A grappled creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed. 

 

• The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated. 

 

• The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by the thunderwave spell.</monsterAction2>
    <monsterAction3>Shadow Jump 
If the boneclaw is in dim light or darkness, each creature of the boneclaw's choice within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take 34 (5d12 + 2) necrotic damage. 

	The boneclaw then magically teleports up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space it can see. It can bring one creature it's grappling, teleporting that creature to an unoccupied space it can see within 5 feet of its destination. The destination spaces of this teleportation must be in dim light or darkness.</monsterAction3>

A cadaver collector doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.</monsterTrait2>
    <monsterTrait3>Magic Resistance 
The cadaver collector has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</monsterTrait3>
    <monsterTrait4>Summon Specters (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest) 
As a bonus action, the cadaver collector calls up the enslaved spirits of those it has slain; 1d6 specters (without Sunlight Sensitivity) arise in unoccupied spaces within 15 feet of the cadaver collector.

    <monsterTrait5>Individual Designs 
A gnome artisan values an individualized clockwork more highly than a perfectly functioning one that copies too much from another creation. For that reason, even clockworks that fit established designs, such as those described here, are seldom identical. 

	A clockwork can be customized by adding one of the following enhancements and one potential malfunction to its stat block. You can select randomly or choose a pair of modifications that fit the temperament of the clockwork's builder. 

 

d10 — Enhancement: 

 

1 — Camouflaged. The clockwork gains proficiency in Stealth if it doesn't already have it. While motionless, it is indistinguishable from a stopped machine. 

 

2 — Sensors. The range of the clockwork's darkvision becomes 120 feet, unless it is higher, and it gains proficiency in Perception if it doesn't already have it. 

 

3 — Improved Armor. The clockwork's AC increases by 2. 

 

4 — Increased Speed. The clockwork's speed increases by 10 feet. 

 

5 — Reinforced Construction. The clockwork has resistance to force, lightning, and thunder damage. 

 

6 — Self-Repairing. If the clockwork starts its turn with at least 1 hit point, it regains 5 hit points. If it takes lightning damage, this ability doesn't function at the start of its next turn. 

 

7 — Sturdy Frame. The clockwork's hit point maximum increases by an amount equal to its number of Hit Dice. 

 

8 — Suction. The clockwork gains a climbing speed of 30 feet. 

 

9 — Vocal Resonator. The clockwork gains the ability to speak rudimentary Common or Gnomish (creator's choice). 

 

10 — Water Propulsion. The clockwork gains a swimming speed of 30 feet. 

 

Clockwork Malfunctions: 

 

d10 — Malfunction 

 

1 — Faulty Sensors. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork is blinded until the end of its turn. 

 

2 — Flawed Targeting. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork makes attack rolls with disadvantage until the end of its turn. 

 

3 — Ground Fault. The clockwork has vulnerability to lightning damage. 

 

4 — Imprinting Loop. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork mistakes one creature it can see within 30 feet for its creator. The clockwork won't willingly harm that creature for 1 minute or until that creature attacks it or deals damage to it. 

 

5 — Leaking Lubricant. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork gains 1 level of exhaustion that it isn't immune to. 

 

6 — Limited Steering. The clockwork must move in a straight line. It can turn up to 90 degrees before moving and again at the midpoint of its movement. It can rotate freely if it doesn't use any of its speeds on its turn. 

 

7 — Overactive Sense of Self-Preservation. If the clockwork has half its hit points or fewer at the start of its turn in combat, roll a d6. If you roll a 1, it retreats from combat. If retreat isn't possible, it continues fighting. 

 

8 — Overheats. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork is incapacitated until the end of its turn. 

 

9 — Rusty Gears. The clockwork has disadvantage on initiative rolls, and its speed decreases by 10 feet. 

 

10 — Weak Armor. The clockwork isn't immune to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks that aren't adamantine.</monsterTrait5>

    <monsterAction1>Bite 
Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or suffer one random poison effect: 

 

1. Poison Damage: The target takes 13 (3d8) poison damage. 

 

2. Confusion: On its next turn, the target must use its action to make one weapon attack against a random creature it can see within 30 feet of it, using whatever weapon it has in hand and moving beforehand if necessary to get in range. If it's holding no weapon, it makes an unarmed strike. If no creature is visible within 30 feet, it takes the Dash action, moving toward the nearest creature. 

 

3. Paralysis: The target is paralyzed until the end of its next turn. 

 

Paralyzed: 

• A paralyzed creature is incapacitated, meaning it can't take actions or reactions, and can't move or speak. 

 

• The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws. 

 

• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage. 

 

• Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.</monsterAction1>

    <monsterAction1>Multiattack 
The oaken bolter makes two lancing bolt attacks or one lancing bolt attack and one harpoon attack.</monsterAction1>
    <monsterAction2>Lancing Bolt 
Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 100/400 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d10 + 4) piercing damage.</monsterAction2>
    <monsterAction3>Harpoon 
Ranged Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, range 50/200 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d10 + 4) piercing damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 12). While grappled in this way, a creature's speed isn't reduced, but it can move only in directions that bring it closer to the oaken bolter. A creature takes 5 (1d10) slashing damage if it escapes from the grapple or if it tries and fails. As a bonus action, the oaken bolter can pull a creature grappled by it 20 feet closer. The oaken bolter can grapple only one creature at a time. 

 

Grappled: 

• A grappled creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed. 

 

• The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated. 

 

• The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by the thunderwave spell.</monsterAction3>
    <monsterAction4>Explosive Bolt (Recharge 5-6) 
The oaken bolter launches an explosive charge at a point within 120 feet. Each creature within 20 feet of that point must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 17 (5d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</monsterAction4>

    <monsterTrait2>Corpses 
When first encountered, a corpse flower contains the corpses of 1d6 + 3 humanoids. A corpse flower can hold the remains of up to nine dead humanoids. These remains have total cover against attacks and other effects outside the corpse flower. If the corpse flower dies, the corpses within it can be pulled free. 

	While it has at least one humanoid corpse in its body, the corpse flower can use a bonus action to do one of the following: 

 

• The corpse flower digests one humanoid corpse in its body and instantly regains 11 (2d10) hit points. Nothing of the digested body remains. Any equipment on the corpse is expelled from the corpse flower in its space. 

 

• The corpse flower animates one dead humanoid in its body, turning it into a zombie. The zombie appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the corpse flower and acts immediately after it in the initiative order. The zombie acts as an ally of the corpse flower but isn't under its control, and the flower's stench clings to it (see the Stench of Death trait).</monsterTrait2>
    <monsterTrait3>Spider Climb 
The corpse flower can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.</monsterTrait3>
    <monsterTrait4>Stench of Death 
Each creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the corpse flower or one of its zombies must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, unless the creature is a construct or undead. On a failed save, the creature is incapacitated until the end of the turn. Creatures that are immune to poison damage or the poisoned condition automatically succeed on this saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is immune to the stench of all corpse flowers for 24 hours. 

 

Incapacitated: 

• An incapacitated creature can't take actions or reactions.</monsterTrait4>
    <monsterAction1>Multiattack 
The corpse flower makes three tentacle attacks.</monsterAction1>
    <monsterAction2>Tentacle 
Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (2d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take 14 (4d6) poison damage.</monsterAction2>
    <monsterAction3>Harvest the Dead 
The corpse flower grabs one unsecured dead humanoid within 10 feet of it and stuffs the corpse into itself, along with any equipment the corpse is wearing or carrying. The remains can be used with the Corpses trait.</monsterAction3>

    <monsterTrait2>Rotting Presence 
When any creature that isn't a demon starts its turn within 30 feet one or more bulezaus, that creature must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 necrotic damage plus 1 necrotic damage for each bulezau within 30 feet of it.</monsterTrait2>
    <monsterTrait3>Standing Leap 
The bulezau's long jump is up to 20 feet and its high jump is up to 10 feet, with or without a running start.</monsterTrait3>

    <monsterAction1>Barbed Tail 
Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d12 + 2) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw against disease or become poisoned until the disease ends. While poisoned in this way, the target sports festering boils, coughs up flies, and sheds rotting skin, and the target must repeat the saving throw after every 24 hours that elapse. On a successful save, the disease ends. On a failed save, the target's hit point maximum is reduced by 4 (1d8). The target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0. 

 

Poisoned: 

• A poisoned creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.</monsterAction1>

    <monsterTrait2>Incoporeal Movement 
The dybbuk can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.</monsterTrait2>
    <monsterTrait3>Innate Spellcasting 
The dybbuk's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 12). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components: 

 

At will: dimension door  

 

3/day each: fear, phantasmal force.</monsterTrait3>
    <monsterTrait4>Magic Resistance 
The dybbuk has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</monsterTrait4>
    <monsterTrait5>Violate Corpse 
The dybbuk can use a bonus action while it is possessing a corpse to make it do something unnatural, such as vomit blood, twist its head all the way around, or cause a quadruped to move as a biped. Any beast or humanoid that sees this behavior must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of the dybbuk for 1 minute. The frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that succeeds on a saving throw against this ability is immune to Violate Corpse for 24 hours. 

 

Frightened: 

• A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight. 

 

• The creature can't willingly move closer to the source of its fear.</monsterTrait5>
    <monsterAction1>Tendril 
Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, its hit point maximum is also reduced by 3 (1d6). This reduction lasts until the target finishes a short or long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.</monsterAction1>
    <monsterAction2>Possess Corpse (Recharge 6) 
The dybbuk disappears into an intact corpse it can see within 5 feet of it. The corpse must be Large or smaller and be that of a beast or a humanoid. The dybbuk is now effectively the possessed creature. Its type becomes undead, though it now looks alive, and it gains a number of temporary hit points equal to the corpse's hit point maximum in life. 

	While possessing the corpse, the dybbuk retains its hit points, alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, telepathy, and immunity to poison damage, exhaustion, and being charmed and frightened. It otherwise uses the possessed target's game statistics, gaining access to its knowledge and proficiencies but not its class features, if any. 

	The possession lasts until the temporary hit points are lost (at which point the body becomes a corpse once more) or the dybbuk ends its possession using a bonus action. When the possession ends, the dybbuk reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the corpse.</monsterAction2>

    <monsterTrait2>Assume Form 
The maurezhi can assume the appearance of any Medium humanoid it has eaten. It remains in this form for 1d6 days, during which time the form gradually decays until, when the effect ends, the form sloughs from the demon's body.</monsterTrait2>
    <monsterTrait3>Magic Resistance 
The maurezhi has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</monsterTrait3>
    <monsterAction1>Multiattack 
The maurezhi makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its claws.</monsterAction1>
    <monsterAction2>Bite 
Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d10 + 3) piercing damage. If the target is a humanoid, its Charisma score is reduced by 1d4. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a short or long rest. The target dies if this reduces its Charisma to 0. It rises 24 hours later as a ghoul, unless it has been revived or its corpse has been destroyed.</monsterAction2>
    <monsterAction3>Claws 
Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) slashing damage. If the target is a creature other than an undead, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. 

 

Paralyzed: 

• A paralyzed creature is incapacitated, meaning it can't take actions or reactions, and can't move or speak. 

 

• The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws. 

 

• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage. 

 

• Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.</monsterAction3>
    <monsterAction4>Raise Ghoul (Recharge 5-6) 
The maurezhi targets one dead ghoul or ghast it can see within 30 feet of it. The target is revived with all its hit points.</monsterAction4>

    <monsterTrait2>Innate Spellcasting 
The molydeus's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 22). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components: 

 

At will: dispel magic, polymorph, telekinesis, teleport  

 

3/day each: lightning bolt  

 

1/day each: imprisonment</monsterTrait2>
    <monsterTrait3>Legendary Resistance (3/Day) 
If the molydeus fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.</monsterTrait3>
    <monsterTrait4>Magic Resistance 
The molydeus has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</monsterTrait4>
    <monsterTrait5>Magic Weapons 
The molydeus's weapon attacks are magical.</monsterTrait5>
    <monsterAction1>Multiattack 
The molydeus makes three attacks: one with its weapon, one with its wolf bite, and one with its snakebite.</monsterAction1>
    <monsterAction2>Demonic Weapon 
Melee Weapon Attack: +16 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 20 (2d10 + 9) slashing damage. If the target has at least one head and the molydeus rolled a 20 on the attack roll, the target is decapitated and dies if it can't survive without that head. A target is immune to this effect if it takes none of the damage, has legendary actions, or is Huge or larger. Such a creature takes an extra 6d8 slashing damage from the hit.</monsterAction2>
    <monsterAction3>Wolf Bite 
Melee Weapon Attack: +16 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d6 + 9) piercing damage.</monsterAction3>
    <monsterAction4>Snakebite 
Melee Weapon Attack: +16 to hit, reach 15 ft., one creature. Hit: 12 (1d6 + 9) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 22 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target transforms into a manes if this reduces its hit point maximum to 0. This transformation can be ended only by a wish spell.</monsterAction4>
    <monsterAction5>Variant: Summon Demon (1/Day) 
As an action, the molydeus has a 50 percent chance of summoning its choice of 1d6 babaus, 1d4 chasmes, or one marilith. A summoned demon appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of the molydeus, acts as an ally of the molydeus, and can't summon other demons. It remains for 1 minute, until it or the molydeus dies, or until the molydeus dismisses it as an action.</monsterAction5>
    <monsterLegendary1>Legendary Actions (3/Turn) 
The molydeus can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The molydeus regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.</monsterLegendary1>
    <monsterLegendary2>Attack 
The molydeus makes one attack, either with its demonic weapon or with its snakebite.</monsterLegendary2>
    <monsterLegendary3>Move 
The molydeus moves without provoking opportunity attacks.</monsterLegendary3>
    <monsterLegendary4>Cast a Spell

    <monsterTrait3>Devour Soul 
A nabassu can eat the soul of a creature it has killed within the last hour, provided that creature is neither a construct nor an undead. The devouring requires the nabassu to be within 5 feet of the corpse for at least 10 minutes, after which it gains a number of Hit Dice (d8s) equal to half the creature's number of Hit Dice. Roll those dice, and increase the nabassu's hit points by the numbers rolled. For every 4 Hit Dice the nabassu gains in this way, its attacks deal an extra 3 (1d6) damage on a hit. The nabassu retains these benefits for 6 days. A creature devoured by a nabassu can be restored to life only by a wish spell.</monsterTrait3>
    <monsterTrait4>Magic Resistance 
The nabassu has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</monsterTrait4>
    <monsterTrait5>Magic Weapons 
The nabassu's weapon attacks are magical.</monsterTrait5>
    <monsterAction1>Multiattack 
The nabassu uses its Soul-Stealing Gaze and makes two attacks: one with its claws and one with its bite.</monsterAction1>
    <monsterAction2>Claws 
Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (2d10 + 6) slashing damage.</monsterAction2>
    <monsterAction3>Bite 
Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 32 (4d12 + 6) piercing damage.</monsterAction3>
    <monsterAction4>Soul-Stealing Gaze 
The nabassu targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can see the nabassu and isn't a construct or an undead, it must succeed on a DC 16 Charisma saving throw or reduce its hit point maximum by 13 (2d12) and give the nabassu an equal number of temporary hit points. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a short or long rest. The target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0, and if the target is a humanoid, it immediately rises as a ghoul under the nabassu's control.</monsterAction4>

    <monsterTrait2>Crippling Fear 
When a creature that isn't a demon starts its turn within 30 feet of three or more rutterkins, it must make a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw. The creature has disadvantage on the save if it's within 30 feet of six or more rutterkins. On a successful save, the creature is immune to the Crippling Fear of all rutterkins for 24 hours. On a failed save, the creature becomes frightened of the rutterkins for 1 minute. While frightened in this way, the creature is restrained. At the end of each of the frightened creature's turns, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. 

 

Frightened: 

• A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight. 

 

• The creature can't willingly move closer to the source of its fear. 

 

Restrained: 

• A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed. 

 

• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage. 

 

• The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.</monsterTrait2>
    <monsterAction1>Bite 
Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (3d6 + 2) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw against disease or become poisoned. At the end of each long rest, the poisoned target can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. If the target is reduced to 0 hit points while poisoned in this way, it dies and instantly transforms into a living abyssal wretch. The transformation of the body can be undone only by a wish spell. 

 

Poisoned: 

• A poisoned creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.</monsterAction1>

    <monsterTrait2>Contamination 
The sibriex emits an aura of corruption 30 feet in every direction. Plants that aren't creatures wither in the aura, and the ground in it is difficult terrain for other creatures. Any creature that starts its turn in the aura must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or take 14 (4d6) poison damage. A creature that succeeds on the save is immune to this sibriex's Contamination for 24 hours.</monsterTrait2>
    <monsterTrait3>Innate Spellcasting 
The sibriex's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 21). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components: 

 

At will: charm person, command, dispel magic, hold monster  

 

3/day each: feeblemind.</monsterTrait3>
    <monsterTrait4>Legendary Resistance (3/Day) 
If the sibriex fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.</monsterTrait4>
    <monsterTrait5>Magic Resistance 
The sibriex has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</monsterTrait5>
    <monsterAction1>Multiattack 
The sibriex uses Squirt Bile once and makes three attacks using its chain, bite, or both.</monsterAction1>
    <monsterAction2>Chain 
Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 20 (2d12 + 7) piercing damage.</monsterAction2>
    <monsterAction3>Bite 
Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (2d8) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) acid damage.</monsterAction3>
    <monsterAction4>Squirt Bile 
The sibriex targets one creature it can see within 120 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or take 35 (10d6) acid damage.</monsterAction4>
    <monsterAction5>Warp Creature 
The sibriex targets up to three creatures it can see within 120 feet of it. Each target must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, a creature becomes immune to this sibriex's Warp Creature. On a failed save, the target is poisoned, which causes it to also gain 1 level of exhaustion. While poisoned in this way, the target must repeat the saving throw at the start of each of its turns. Three successful saves against the poison end it, and ending the poison removes any levels of exhaustion caused by it. Each failed save causes the target to suffer another level of exhaustion. Once the target reaches 6 levels of exhaustion, it dies and instantly transforms into a living abyssal wretch under the sibriex's control. The transformation of the body can be undone only by a wish spell. 

 

Exhaustion: 

	Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect's description. 

 

Level — Effect: 

1 —Disadvantage on ability checks 

2 —Speed halved 

3 —Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws 

4 —Hit point maximum halved 

5 —Speed reduced to 0 

	6 —Death 

 

If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect's description. 

	A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks. 

	An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect's description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature's exhaustion level is reduced below 1. 

	Finishing a long rest reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink. 

 

Poisoned: 

• A poisoned creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.</monsterAction5>
    <monsterAction6>Variant: Flesh Warping 
Creatures that encounter a sibriex can be twisted beyond recognition. Whenever a creature fails a saving throw against the sibriex's Warp Creature effect, you can roll percentile dice and consult the Flesh Warping table to determine an additional effect, which vanishes when Warp Creature ends on the creature. If the creature transforms into an abyssal wretch, the effect becomes a permanent feature of that body. 

	A creature can willingly submit to flesh warping, an agonizing process that takes at least 1 hour while the creature stays within 30 feet of the sibriex. At the end of the process, roll once on the table (or choose one effect) to determine how the creature is transformed permanently. 

 

d100 — Effect: 

 

01–05 — The color of the target's hair, eyes, and skin becomes blue, red, yellow, or patterned. 

 

06–10 — The target's eyes push out of its head at the end of stalks. 

 

11–15 — The target's hands grow claws, which can be used as daggers. 

 

16–20 — One of the target's legs grows longer than the other, reducing its walking speed by 10 feet. 

 

21–25 — The target's eyes become beacons, filling a 15-foot cone with dim light when they are open. 

 

26–30 — A pair of wings, either feathered or leathery, sprout from the target's back, granting it a flying speed of 30 feet. 

 

31–35 — The target's ears tear free from its head and scurry away; the target is deafened. 

 

36–40 — Two of the target's teeth turn into tusks. 

 

41–45 — The target's skin becomes scabby, granting it a +1 bonus to AC but reducing its Charisma by 2 (to a minimum of 1). 

 

46–50 — The target's arms and legs switch places, preventing the target from moving unless it crawls. 

 

51–55 — The target's arms become tentacles with fingers on the ends, increasing its reach by 5 feet. 

 

56–60 — The target's legs grow incredibly long and springy, increasing its walking speed by 10 feet. 

 

61–65 — The target grows a whiplike tail, which it can use as a whip. 

 

66–70 — The target's eyes turn black, and it gains darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. 

 

71–75 — The target swells, tripling its weight. 

 

76–80 — The target becomes thin and skeletal, halving its weight. 

 

81–85 — The target's head doubles in size. 

 

86–90 — The target's ears become wings, giving it a flying speed of 5 feet. 

 

91–95 — The target's body becomes unusually brittle, causing the target to have vulnerability to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. 

 

96–00 — The target grows another head, causing it to have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, frightened, or stunned. 

 

Deafened: 

• A deafened creature can't hear and automatically fails any ability check that requires hearing. </monsterAction6>

The wastrilith can breathe air and water.</monsterTrait2>
    <monsterTrait3>Corrupt Water 
At the start of each of the wastrilith's turns, exposed water within 30 feet of it is befouled. Underwater, this effect lightly obscures the area until a current clears it away. Water in containers remains corrupted until it evaporates. 

	A creature that consumes this foul water or swims in it must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is immune to the foul water for 24 hours. On a failed save, the creature takes 14 (4d6) poison damage and is poisoned for 1 minute. At the end of this time, the poisoned creature must repeat the saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 18 (4d8) poison damage and is poisoned until it finishes a long rest. 

	If another demon drinks the foul water as an action, it gains 11 (2d10) temporary hit points.

    <monsterAction4>Grasping Spout 
The wastrilith magically launches a spout of water at one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. The target must make a DC 17 Strength saving throw, and it has disadvantage if it's underwater. On a failed save, it takes 22 (4d8 + 4) acid damage and is pulled up to 60 feet toward the wastrilith. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't pulled.</monsterAction4>

The poisoned target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. 

 

Poisoned: 

• A poisoned creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.</monsterAction3>

    <monsterTrait4>Magic Weapons 
The abishai's weapon attacks are magical.</monsterTrait4>
    <monsterAction1>Multiattack 
The abishai can use its Frightful Presence. It also makes three attacks: one with its morningstar, one with its claw, and one with its bite.</monsterAction1>
    <monsterAction2>Morningstar 
Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (1d8 + 6) piercing damage.</monsterAction2>
    <monsterAction3>Claw 
Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (2d10 + 6) slashing damage.</monsterAction3>
    <monsterAction4>Bite 
Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 22 (5d10 + 6) piercing damage plus 38 (7d10) fire damage.</monsterAction4>
    <monsterAction5>Frightful Presence 
Each creature of the abishai's choice that is within 120 feet and aware of it must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of it for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the abishai's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours. 

 

Frightened: 

• A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight. 

 

• The creature can't willingly move closer to the source of its fear.</monsterAction5>
    <monsterAction6>Incite Fanaticism 
The abishai chooses up to four of its allies within 60 feet of it that can see it. For 1 minute, each of those allies makes attack rolls with advantage and can't be frightened.</monsterAction6>
    <monsterAction7>Power of the Dragon Queen 
The abishai targets one dragon it can see within 120 feet of it. The dragon must make a DC 18 Charisma saving throw. A chromatic dragon makes this save with disadvantage. On a successful save, the target is immune to the abishai's Power of the Dragon Queen for 1 hour. On a failed save, the target is charmed by the abishai for 1 hour. While charmed in this way, the target regards the abishai as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. This effect ends if the abishai or its companions deal damage to the target. 

 

Charmed: 

• A charmed creature can't attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects. 

 

• The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature.</monsterAction7>

Magical darkness doesn't impede the amnizu's darkvision.</monsterTrait2>
    <monsterTrait3>Innate Spellcasting 
The amnizu's innate spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save 19, +11 to hit with spell attacks). The amnizu can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components: 

 

At will: charm person, command  

 

3/day each: dominate person, fireball  

 

1/day each: dominate monster, feeblemind.</monsterTrait3>
    <monsterTrait4>Magic Resistance 
The amnizu has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</monsterTrait4>
    <monsterAction1>Multiattack 
The amnizu uses Poison Mind. It also makes two attacks: one with its whip and one with its Disruptive Touch.</monsterAction1>
    <monsterAction2>Taskmaster Whip 
Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d4 + 5) slashing damage plus 33 (6d10) force damage.</monsterAction2>
    <monsterAction3>Disruptive Touch 
Melee Spell Attack: +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 44 (8d10) necrotic damage.</monsterAction3>
    <monsterAction4>Poison Mind 
The amnizu targets one or two creatures that it can see within 60 feet of it. Each target must succeed on a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or take 26 (4d12) necrotic damage and be blinded until the start of the amnizu's next turn. 

 

Blinded: 

• A blinded creature can't see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight. 

 

• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.</monsterAction4>
    <monsterAction5>Forgetfulness (Recharge 6) 
The amnizu targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. That creature must succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence saving throw or become stunned for 1 minute. A stunned creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If the target is stunned for the full minute, it forgets everything it sensed, experienced, and learned during the last 5 hours. 

 

Stunned: 

• A stunned creature is incapacitated, meaning it can't take actions or reactions, can't move, and can speak only falteringly. 

 

• The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws. 

 

• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.</monsterAction5>
    <monsterAction6>Variant: Summon Devil (1/Day) 
The amnizu summons 2d4 bearded devils or 1d4 barbed devils. A summoned devil appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of the amnizu, acts as an ally of the amnizu, and can't summon other devils. It remains for 1 minute, until the amnizu dies, or until its summoner dismisses it as an action.</monsterAction6>

    <monsterTrait2>Constructed Nature 
A hellfire engine doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.</monsterTrait2>
    <monsterTrait3>Immutable Form 
The hellfire engine is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.</monsterTrait3>
    <monsterTrait4>Magic Resistance 
The hellfire engine has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</monsterTrait4>
    <monsterAction1>Flesh-Crushing Stride 
The hellfire engine moves up to its speed in a straight line. During this move, it can enter Large or smaller creatures' spaces. A creature whose space the hellfire engine enters must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is pushed 5 feet to the nearest space out of the hellfire engine's path. On a failed save, the creature falls prone and takes 28 (8d6) bludgeoning damage. 

	If the hellfire engine remains in the prone creature's space, the creature is also restrained until it's no longer in the same space as the hellfire engine. While restrained in this way, the creature, or another creature within 5 feet of it, can make a DC 18 Strength check. On a success, the creature is shunted to an unoccupied space of its choice within 5 feet of the hellfire engine and is no longer restrained. 

 

Prone: 

• A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition. 

 

• The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls. 

 

• An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage. 

 

Restrained: 

• A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed. 

 

• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage. 

 

• The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.</monsterAction1>
    <monsterAction2>Hellfire Weapons 
The hellfire engine uses one of the following options: Bonemelt Sprayer. The hellfire engine spews acidic flame in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in the cone must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 11 (2d10) fire damage plus 18 (4d8) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures that fail the saving throw are drenched in burning acid and take 5 (1d10) fire damage plus 9 (2d8) acid damage at the end of their turns. An affected creature or another creature within 5 feet of it can take an action to scrape off the burning fuel.</monsterAction2>
    <monsterAction3>Lightning Flail 
Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 15 ft., one creature. Hit: 18 (3d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 22 (5d8) lightning damage. Up to three other creatures of the hellfire engine's choice that it can see within 30 feet of the target must each make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (5d8) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</monsterAction3>
    <monsterAction4>Thunder Cannon 
The hellfire engine targets a point within 120 feet of it that it can see. Each creature within 30 feet of that point must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 27 (5d10) bludgeoning damage plus 13 (2d12) thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 

	If the chosen option kills a creature, the creature's soul rises from the River Styx as a lemure in Avernus in 1d4 hours. If the creature isn't revived before then, only a wish spell or killing the lemure and casting true resurrection on the creature's original body can restore it to life. Constructs and devils are immune to this effect.</monsterAction4>

    <monsterAction2>Hellfire Lance 
Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (1d12 + 5) piercing damage plus 16 (3d10) fire damage. If this damage kills a creature, the creature's soul rises from the River Styx as a lemure in Avernus in 1d4 hours.

    <monsterAction3>Infernal Command 
Each ally of the narzugon within 60 feet of it can't be charmed or frightened until the end of the narzugon's next turn.</monsterAction3>
    <monsterAction4>Terrifying Command 
Each creature that isn't a fiend within 60 feet of the narzugon that can hear it must succeed on a DC 17 Charisma saving throw or become frightened of it for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that makes a successful saving throw is immune to this narzugon's Terrifying Command for 24 hours. 

 

Frightened: 

• A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight. 

 

• The creature can't willingly move closer to the source of its fear.</monsterAction4>

      <text>When it is reduced to 15 hit points or fewer, the orthon causes itself to explode. All other creatures within 30 feet of it must each make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 9 (2d8) fire damage plus 9 (2d8) thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

    <monsterTrait2>Invisibility Field 
The orthon can use a bonus action to become invisible. Any equipment the orthon wears or carries is also invisible as long as the equipment is on its person. This invisibility ends immediately after the orthon makes an attack roll or is hit by an attack. 

 

Invisible: 

• An invisible creature is impossible to see without the aid of magic or a special sense. For the purpose of hiding, the creature is heavily obscured. The creature's location can be detected by any noise it makes or any tracks it leaves. 

 

• Attack rolls against the creature have disadvantage, and the creature's attack rolls have advantage.</monsterTrait2>
    <monsterTrait3>Magic Resistance 
The orthon has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</monsterTrait3>
    <monsterAction1>Infernal Dagger 
Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d4 + 6) slashing damage, and the target must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On a failure, the target is also poisoned for 1 minute. The poisoned target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. 

 

Poisoned: 

• A poisoned creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.</monsterAction1>
    <monsterAction2>Infernal Crossbow 
Ranged Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, range 100/400 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d10 + 3) piercing damage, plus one of the following effects: 

 

1. Acid. The target must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking an additional 17 (5d6) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 

 

2. Blindness (1/Day). The target takes 5 (1d10) radiant damage. In addition, the target and all other creatures within 20 feet of it must each make a successful DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be blinded until the end of the orthon's next turn. 

 

3. Concussion. The target and each creature within 20 feet of it must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 13 (2d12) thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 

 

4. Entanglement. The target must make a successful DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be restrained for 1 hour by strands of sticky webbing. A restrained creature can escape by using an action to make a successful DC 17 Dexterity or Strength check. Any creature other than an orthon that touches the restrained creature must make a successful DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or become similarly restrained. 

 

5. Paralysis (1/Day). The target takes 22 (4d10) lightning damage and must make a successful DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The paralyzed target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. 

 

6. Tracking. For the next 24 hours, the orthon knows the direction and distance to the target, as long as it's on the same plane of existence. If the target is on a different plane, the orthon knows which one, but not the exact location there. 

 

Blinded: 

• A blinded creature can't see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight. 

 

• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage. 

 

Paralyzed: 

• A paralyzed creature is incapacitated, meaning it can't take actions or reactions, and can't move or speak. 

 

• The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws. 

 

• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage. 

 

• Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. 

 

Restrained: 

• A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed. 

 

• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage. 

 

• The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.</monsterAction2>

    <monsterTrait5>Magic Weapons

    <monsterTrait6>Regeneration 
Geryon regains 20 hit points at the start of his turn. If he takes radiant damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of his next turn. Geryon dies only if he starts his turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.</monsterTrait6>
    <monsterAction1>Multiattack 
Geryon makes two attacks: one with his claws and one with his stinger.</monsterAction1>
    <monsterAction2>Claws 
Melee Weapon Attack: +16 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 23 (4d6 + 9) slashing damage. If the target is Large or smaller, it is grappled (DC 24) and restrained until the grapple ends.

Grappled: 

• A grappled creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed. 

 

• The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated. 

 

• The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by the thunderwave spell.

• Geryon causes a blast of cold to burst from the ground at a point he can see within 120 feet of him. The cold fills a cube, 10 feet on each side, centered on that point. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or take 28 (8d6) cold damage. 

 

• Geryon targets one creature he can see within 60 feet of him. The target must succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or become restrained for 1 minute. The target can end the effect on itself if it deals any damage to one or more of its allies.

    <monsterLegendary1>Legendary Actions (3/Turn) 
Geryon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Geryon regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.</monsterLegendary1>

    <monsterTrait5>Magic Weapons 
Titivilus's weapon attacks are magical.</monsterTrait5>
    <monsterTrait6>Regeneration 
Titivilus regains 10 hit points at the start of his turn. If he takes cold or radiant damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of his next turn. Titivilus dies only if he starts his turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.</monsterTrait6>
    <monsterTrait7>Ventiloquism 
Whenever Titivilus speaks, he can choose a point within 60 feet; his voice emanates from that point.</monsterTrait7>
    <monsterAction1>Multiattack 
Titivilus makes one sword attack and uses his Frightful Word once.</monsterAction1>
    <monsterAction2>Silver Sword 
Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) slashing damage, or 9 (1d10 + 4) slashing damage if used with two hands, plus 16 (3d10) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to half the necrotic damage it takes.</monsterAction2>
    <monsterAction3>Frightful Word 
Titivilus targets one creature he can see within 10 feet of him. The target must succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of him for 1 minute. While frightened in this way, the target must take the Dash action and move away from Titivilus by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move, in which case it needn't take the Dash action. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. 

 

Frightened: 

• A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight. 

 

• The creature can't willingly move closer to the source of its fear.</monsterAction3>

Charmed: 

• A charmed creature can't attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects. 

 

• The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature.</monsterAction5>
    <monsterLegendary1>Legendary Actions (3/Turn) 
Titivilus can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Titivilus regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.</monsterLegendary1>

    <monsterAction5>Enlarge (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest) 
For 1 minute, the duergar magically increases in size, along with anything it is wearing or carrying. While enlarged, the duergar is Large, doubles its damage dice on Strength-based weapon attacks (included in the attacks), and makes Strength checks and Strength saving throws with advantage. If the duergar lacks the room to become Large, it attains the maximum size possible in the space available.</monsterAction5>
    <monsterAction6>Invisibility (Recharge 4-6) 
The duergar magically turns invisible for up to 1 hour or until it attacks, it casts a spell, it uses its Enlarge, or its concentration is broken (as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment the duergar wears or carries is invisible with it. 

 

Invisible:

    <monsterTrait2>Undead Nature 
An eidolon doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.</monsterTrait2>
    <monsterTrait3>Incorporeal Movement 
The eidolon can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object other than a sacred statue.</monsterTrait3>
    <monsterTrait4>Sacred Animation (Recharge 5-6) 
When the eidolon moves into a space occupied by a sacred statue, the eidolon can disappear, causing the statue to become a creature under the eidolon's control. The eidolon uses the sacred statue's statistics in place of its own.</monsterTrait4>
    <monsterTrait5>Turn Resistance 
The eidolon has advantage on saving throws against any effect that turns undead.</monsterTrait5>
    <monsterAction1>Divine Dread 
Each creature within 60 feet of the eidolon that can see it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of it for 1 minute. While frightened in this way, the creature must take the Dash action and move away from the eidolon by the safest available route at the start of each of its turns, unless there is nowhere for it to move, in which case the creature also becomes stunned until it can move again. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to any eidolon's Divine Dread for the next 24 hours. 

 

Frightened: 

• A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight. 

 

• The creature can't willingly move closer to the source of its fear. 

 

Stunned: 

• A stunned creature is incapacitated, meaning it can't take actions or reactions, can't move, and can speak only falteringly. 

 

• The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws. 

 

• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.</monsterAction1>

While submerged, the leviathan magically creates a wall of water centered on itself. The wall is up 250 feet long, up to 250 feet high, and up to 50 feet thick. 

	When the wall appears, all other creatures within its area must each make a DC 24 Strength saving throw. A creature takes 33 (6d10) bludgeoning damage on failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 

	At the start of each of the leviathan's turns after the wall appears, the wall, along with any other creatures in it, moves 50 feet away from the leviathan. Any Huge or smaller creature inside the wall or whose space the wall enters when it moves must succeed on a DC 24 Strength saving throw or take 27 (5d10) bludgeoning damage. A creature takes this damage no more than once on a turn. At the end of each turn the wall moves, the wall's height is reduced by 50 feet, and the damage creatures take from the wall on subsequent rounds is reduced by 1d10. When the wall reaches 0 feet in height, the effect ends. 

	A creature caught in the wall can move by swimming. Because of the force of the wave, though, the creature must make a successful DC 24 Strength (Athletics) check to swim at all during that turn.</monsterAction4>

    <monsterTrait2>Fiery Death and Rebirth 
When the phoenix dies, it explodes. Each creature within 60-feet of it must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't worn or carried. 

	The explosion destroys the phoenix's body and leaves behind an egg-shaped cinder that weighs 5 pounds. The cinder is blazing hot, dealing 21 (6d6) fire damage to any creature that touches it, though no more than once per round. The cinder is immune to all damage, and after 1d6 days, it hatches a new phoenix.</monsterTrait2>
    <monsterTrait3>Fire Form 
The phoenix can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing. Any creature that touches the phoenix or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 5 (1d10) fire damage. In addition, the phoenix can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. The first time it enters a creature's space on a turn, that creature takes 5 (1d10) fire damage. With a touch, the phoenix can also ignite flammable objects that aren't worn or carried (no action required).</monsterTrait3>

Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d6 + 8) fire damage. If the target is a creature or a flammable object, it ignites. Until a creature takes an action to douse the fire, the target takes 5 (1d10) fire damage at the start of each of its turns.</monsterAction2>
    <monsterAction3>Fiery Talons 
Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (2d8 + 8) fire damage.</monsterAction3>

    <monsterTrait5>Living Storm 
The tempest is always at the center of a storm 1d6 + 4 miles in diameter. Heavy precipitation in the form of either rain or snow falls there, causing the area to be lightly obscured. Heavy rain also extinguishes open flames and imposes disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing. 

	In addition, strong winds swirl in the area covered by the storm. The winds impose disadvantage on ranged attack rolls. The winds extinguish open flames and disperse fog.</monsterTrait5>
    <monsterTrait6>Siege Monster 
The tempest deals double damage to objects and structures.</monsterTrait6>
    <monsterAction1>Multiattack 
The tempest makes two attacks with its thunderous slam.</monsterAction1>

Melee Weapon Attack: +16 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 23 (4d6 + 9) thunder damage.</monsterAction2>
    <monsterAction3>Lightning Storm (Recharge 6) 
All other creatures within 120 feet of the tempest must each make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 27 (6d8) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If a target's saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is also stunned until the end of its next turn. 

 

Stunned: 

• A stunned creature is incapacitated, meaning it can't take actions or reactions, can't move, and can speak only falteringly. 

 

• The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws. 

 

• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.</monsterAction3>

The tempest can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The tempest regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.</monsterLegendary1>
    <monsterLegendary2>Move 
The tempest moves up to its speed.</monsterLegendary2>
    <monsterLegendary3>Lightning Strike (Costs 2 Actions) 
The tempest can cause a bolt of lightning to strike a point on the ground anywhere under its storm. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 16 (3d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</monsterLegendary3>
    <monsterLegendary4>Screaming Gale (Costs 3 Actions) 
The tempest releases a blast of thunder and wind in a line that is 1 mile long and 20 feet wide. Objects in that area take 22 (4d10) thunder damage. Each creature there must succeed on a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw or take 22 (4d10) thunder damage and be flung up to 60 feet in a direction away from the line. If a thrown target collides with an immovable object, such as a wall or floor, the target takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown before impact. If the target would collide with another creature instead, that other creature must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked prone.</monsterLegendary4>

    <monsterTrait2>Earth-Shaking Movement 
As a bonus action after moving at least 10 feet on the ground, the zaratan can send a shock wave through the ground in a 120-foot-radius circle centered on itself. That area becomes difficult terrain for 1 minute. Each creature on the ground that is concentrating must succeed on a DC 25 Constitution saving throw or the creature's concentration is broken. 

	The shock wave deals 100 thunder damage to all structures in contact with the ground in the area. If a creature is near a structure that collapses, the creature might be buried; a creature within half the distance of the structure's height must make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 17 (5d6) bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and is trapped in the rubble. A trapped creature is restrained, requiring a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check as an action to escape. Another creature within 5 feet of the buried creature can use its action to clear rubble and grant advantage on the check. If three creatures use their actions in this way, the check is an automatic success. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and doesn't fall prone or become trapped. 

 

Prone: 

• A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition. 

 

• The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls. 

 

• An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage. 

 

Restrained: 

• A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed. 

 

• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage. 

 

• The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.</monsterTrait2>

    <monsterAction5>Spew Debris (Recharge 5-6) 
The zaratan exhales rocky debris in a 90-foot cube. Each creature in that area must make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 33 (6d10) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that fails the save by 5 or more is knocked prone. 

 

Prone: 

• A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition. 

 

• The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls. 

 

• An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.</monsterAction5>

The zaratan can use this option only if it is retracted in its shell. It regains 52 (5d20) hit points. The next time it takes a legendary action, it must take its Emerge action.</monsterLegendary6>

The anarch's innate spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 18, +10 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no components: 

 

At will: mage hand (the hand is invisible) 

 

3/day each: feather fall, jump, see invisibility, shield, telekinesis  

 

1/day each: globe of invulnerability, plane shift, teleportation circle, wall of force.</monsterTrait2>
    <monsterTrait3>Psychic Defense 
While the anarch is wearing no armor and wielding no shield, its AC includes its Wisdom modifier.</monsterTrait3>
    <monsterAction1>Multiattack 
The githzerai makes three unarmed strikes.</monsterAction1>
    <monsterAction2>Unarmed Strike 
Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 13 (3d8) psychic damage.</monsterAction2>
    <monsterAction3>Temporal Strike (Recharge 6) 
Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 52 (8d12) psychic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or move 1 round forward in time. A target moved forward in time vanishes for the duration. When the effect ends, the target reappears in the space it left or in an unoccupied space nearest to that space if it's occupied.</monsterAction3>
    <monsterAction4>Lair Actions 
An anarch can use lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the anarch can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the anarch can't use the same effect two rounds in a row: 

 

• The anarch casts the lightning bolt spell (at 5th level), but the anarch can change the damage type from lightning to cold, fire, psychic, radiant, or thunder. If the spell deals damage other than fire or lightning, it doesn't ignite flammable objects. 

 

• The anarch casts the creation spell (as a 9th-level spell) using the unformed substance of Limbo instead of shadow material. If used in Limbo, the object remains until the anarch's concentration is broken, regardless of its composition. If the anarch moves more than 120 feet from the object, its concentration breaks. 

 

• The anarch can magically move an object it can see within 150 feet of it by making a Wisdom check with advantage. The DC depends on the object's size: DC 5 for Tiny, DC 10 for Small, DC 15 for Medium, DC 20 for Large, and DC 25 for Huge or larger.</monsterAction4>
    <monsterLegendary1>Legendary Actions (3/Turn) 
The anarch can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The anarch regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.</monsterLegendary1>
    <monsterLegendary2>Strike 
The anarch makes one unarmed strike.</monsterLegendary2>
    <monsterLegendary3>Teleport 
The anarch magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing and carrying, to an unoccupied space it can see within 30 feet of it.</monsterLegendary3>
    <monsterLegendary4>Change Gravity (Costs 3 Actions) 
The anarch casts the reverse gravity spell. The spell has the normal effect, except that the anarch can orient the area in any direction and creatures and objects fall toward the end of the area.</monsterLegendary4>

The marut is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.</monsterTrait3>
    <monsterTrait4>Innate Spellcasting 
The marut's innate spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 20). The marut can innately cast the following spell, requiring no material components. 

 

At will: plane shift (self only).</monsterTrait4>
    <monsterTrait5>Legendary Resistance (3/Day) 
If the marut fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.</monsterTrait5>
    <monsterTrait6>Magic Resistance

    <monsterAction3>Blazing Edict (Recharge 5-6) 
Arcane energy emanates from the marut's chest in a 60-foot cube. Every creature in that area takes 45 radiant damage. Each creature that takes any of this damage must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or be stunned until the end of the marut's next turn. 

 

Stunned: 

• A stunned creature is incapacitated, meaning it can't take actions or reactions, can't move, and can speak only falteringly. 

 

• The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws. 

 

• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.</monsterAction3>
    <monsterAction4>Justify

Each target must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma saving throw or be teleported to a teleportation circle in the Hall of Concordance in Sigil. A target fails automatically if it is incapacitated. If either target is teleported in this way, the marut teleports with it to the circle. 

	After teleporting in this way, the marut can't use this action again until it finishes a short or long rest.</monsterAction4>

The destination must be a place the meazel has seen before, but it need not be within line of sight. If the destination space is occupied, the teleportation leads to the nearest unoccupied space. 

	Any other creature the meazel teleports becomes cursed by shadow for 1 hour. Until this curse ends, every undead and every creature native to the Shadowfell within 300 feet of the cursed creature can sense it, which prevents that creature from hiding from them.</monsterAction3>

    <monsterTrait2>Ooze Nature 
An oblex doesn't require sleep.</monsterTrait2>
    <monsterTrait3>Amorphous 
The oblex can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.</monsterTrait3>
    <monsterTrait4>Aversion to Fire 
If the oblex takes fire damage, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the end of its next turn.</monsterTrait4>
    <monsterTrait5>Innate Spellcasting 
The oblex's innate spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 15). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no components: 

 

3/day each: charm person (as 5th-level spell), color spray, detect thoughts, hold person (as 3rd-level spell).</monsterTrait5>
    <monsterTrait6>Sulfurous Impersonation 
As a bonus action, the oblex can extrude a piece of itself that assumes the appearance of one Medium or smaller creature whose memories it has stolen. This simulacrum appears, feels, and sounds exactly like the creature it impersonates, though it smells faintly of sulfur. The oblex can impersonate 1d4 + 1 different creatures, each one tethered to its body by a strand of slime that can extend up to 120 feet away. For all practical purposes, the simulacrum is the oblex, meaning that the oblex occupies its space and the simulacrum's space simultaneously. The slimy tether is immune to damage, but it is severed if there is no opening at least 1 inch wide between the oblex's main body and the simulacrum. The simulacrum disappears if the tether is severed.</monsterTrait6>
    <monsterAction1>Multiattack 
The oblex makes one pseudopod attack and uses Eat Memories.</monsterAction1>
    <monsterAction2>Pseudopod 
Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 5 (2d4) psychic damage.</monsterAction2>
    <monsterAction3>Eat Memories 
The oblex targets one creature it can see within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 18 (4d8) psychic damage and become memory drained until it finishes a short or long rest or until it benefits from the greater restoration or heal spell. Constructs, oozes, plants, and undead succeed on the save automatically. 

	While memory drained, the target must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from any ability check or attack roll it makes. Each time the target is memory drained beyond the first, the die size increases by one: the d4 becomes a d6, the d6 becomes a d8, and so on until the die becomes a d20, at which point the target becomes unconscious for 1 hour. The effect then ends. 

	When an oblex causes a target to become memory drained, the oblex learns all the languages the target knows and gains all its proficiencies, except for any saving throw proficiencies. 

 

Unconscious: 

• An unconscious creature is incapacitated, meaning it can't take actions or reactions, can't move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings. 

 

• The creature drops whatever it's holding and falls prone. 

 

• The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws. 

 

• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage. 

 

• Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.</monsterAction3>

    <monsterAction2>Chain Sweep 
The ogre swings its chain, and every creature within 10 feet of it must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed saving throw, a creature takes 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone. 

 

Prone: 

• A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition. 

 

• The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.

The unconscious target repeats the saving throw if it takes damage and at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. 

 

Unconscious: 

• An unconscious creature is incapacitated, meaning it can't take actions or reactions, can't move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings. 

 

• The creature drops whatever it's holding and falls prone. 

 

• The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.

    <monsterTrait3>Innate Spellcasting 
The soul monger's innate spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 16, +8 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components: 

 

At will: chill touch (3d8 damage), poison spray (3d12 damage) 

 

1/day each: bestow curse, chain lightning, finger of death, gaseous form, phantasmal killer, seeming.</monsterTrait3>
    <monsterTrait4>Magic Resistance 
The soul monger has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</monsterTrait4>
    <monsterTrait5>Soul Thirst 
When the soul monger reduces a creature to 0 hit points, the soul monger can gain temporary hit points equal to half the creature's hit point maximum. While the soul monger has temporary hit points from this ability, it has advantage on attack rolls.</monsterTrait5>
    <monsterTrait6>Weight of Ages 
Any beast or humanoid, other than a shadar-kai, that starts its turn within 5 feet of the soul monger has its speed reduced by 20 feet until the start of that creature's next turn.</monsterTrait6>
    <monsterAction1>Multiattack 
The soul monger makes two phantasmal dagger attacks.</monsterAction1>
    <monsterAction2>Phantasmal Dagger 
Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (4d4 + 3) piercing damage plus 19 (3d12) necrotic damage, and the target has disadvantage on saving throws until the start of the soul monger's next turn.</monsterAction2>
    <monsterAction3>Wave of Weariness (Recharge 4-6) 
The soul monger emits weariness in a 60-foot cube. Each creature in that area must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 45 (10d8) psychic damage and suffers 1 level of exhaustion. On a successful save, it takes 22 (5d8) psychic damage. 

 

Exhaustion: 

	Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect's description. 

 

Level — Effect: 

1 —Disadvantage on ability checks 

2 —Speed halved 

3 —Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws 

4 —Hit point maximum halved 

5 —Speed reduced to 0 

	6 —Death 

 

If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect's description. 

	A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks. 

	An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect's description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature's exhaustion level is reduced below 1. 

	Finishing a long rest reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink.</monsterAction3>

    <monsterTrait2>Fallible Invisibility 
The skulk is invisible. This invisibility can be circumvented by three things: 

 

• The skulk appears as a drab, smooth-skinned humanoid if its reflection can be seen in a mirror or on another surface. 

 

• The skulk appears as a dim, translucent form in the light of a candle made of fat rendered from a corpse whose identity is unknown. 

 

• Humanoid children, aged 10 and under, can see through this invisibility. 

 

Invisible: 

• An invisible creature is impossible to see without the aid of magic or a special sense. For the purpose of hiding, the creature is heavily obscured. The creature's location can be detected by any noise it makes or any tracks it leaves. 

 

• Attack rolls against the creature have disadvantage, and the creature's attack rolls have advantage.</monsterTrait2>

• The air within 60 feet of the ship is filled with howling wind. Until initiative count 20 on the next round, that area is difficult terrain, and when a Medium or smaller creature flies into that area or starts its turn flying there, it must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. 

 

Prone: 

• A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition. 

 

• The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls. 

 

• An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.</monsterAction4>

    <monsterTrait2>Bringer of Plagues (Recharge 5-6) 
As a bonus action, the oinoloth blights the area within 30 feet of it. The blight lasts for 24 hours. While blighted, all normal plants in the area wither and die, and the number of hit points restored by a spell to a creature in that area is halved. 

	Furthermore, when a creature moves into the blighted area or starts its turn there, that creature must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is immune to the oinoloth's Bringer of Plagues for the next 24 hours. On a failed save, the creature takes 14 (4d6) necrotic damage and is poisoned. 

	The poisoned creature can't regain hit points. After every 24 hours that elapse, the poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's hit point maximum is reduced by 5 (1d10). This reduction lasts until the poison ends, and the target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0. The poison ends after the creature successfully saves against it three times. 

 

Poisoned: 

• A poisoned creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.</monsterTrait2>
    <monsterTrait3>Innate Spellcasting 
The oinoloth's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 16). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components: 

 

At will: darkness, detect magic, dispel magic, invisibility (self only) 

 

1/day each: feeblemind, globe of invulnerability, wall of fire, wall of ice.</monsterTrait3>
    <monsterTrait4>Magic Resistance 
The oinoloth has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</monsterTrait4>
    <monsterTrait5>Magic Weapons 
The oinoloth's weapon attacks are magical.</monsterTrait5>
    <monsterAction1>Multiattack 
The oinoloth uses its Transfixing Gaze and makes two claw attacks.</monsterAction1>
    <monsterAction2>Claw 
Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (3d6 + 4) slashing damage plus 22 (4d10) necrotic damage.</monsterAction2>
    <monsterAction3>Corrupted Healing (Recharge 6) 
The oinoloth touches one willing creature within 5 feet of it. The target regains all its hit points. In addition, the oinoloth can end one disease on the target or remove one of the following conditions from it: blinded, deafened, paralyzed, or poisoned. The target then gains 1 level of exhaustion, and its hit point maximum is reduced by 7 (2d6). This reduction can be removed only by a wish spell or by casting greater restoration on the target three times within the same hour. The target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0. 

 

Exhaustion: 

	Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect's description. 

 

Level — Effect: 

1 —Disadvantage on ability checks 

2 —Speed halved 

3 —Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws 

4 —Hit point maximum halved 

5 —Speed reduced to 0 

	6 —Death 

 

If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect's description. 

	A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks. 

	An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect's description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature's exhaustion level is reduced below 1. 

	Finishing a long rest reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink.</monsterAction3>
    <monsterAction4>Teleport 
The oinoloth magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.</monsterAction4>
    <monsterAction5>Transfixing Gaze 
The oinoloth targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or be charmed until the end of the oinoloth's next turn. While charmed in this way, the target is restrained. If the target's saving throw is successful, the target is immune to the oinoloth's gaze for the next 24 hours. 

 

Charmed: 

• A charmed creature can't attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects. 

 

• The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature. 

 

Restrained: 

• A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed. 

 

• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.
