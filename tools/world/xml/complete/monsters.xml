When all five have finished their third turn of the dance, the elemental appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of them. It is friendly toward them and obeys their spoken commands. It remains for 1 hour, until it or all its summoners die, or until any of its summoners dismisses it as a bonus action. A summoner can't perform the dance again until it finishes a short rest. When the elemental returns to the Elemental Plane of Air, any aarakocra within 5 feet of it can return with it.</action3>

While the table remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal table.</trait4>
    <trait5>Charge
If the table moves at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a ram attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 9 (2d8) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.



Prone:

• A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.



• The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.



• An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.</trait5>

Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6+3) slashing damage plus 3 (1d6) acid damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 13). Until this grapple ends, the ankheg can bite only the grappled creature and has advantage on attack rolls to do so.



Grappled:

• A grappled creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.



• The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated.



• The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by the thunderwave spell.</action1>
    <action2>Acid Spray (Recharge 6)
The ankheg spits acid in a line that is 30 ft. long and 5 ft. wide, provided that it has no creature grappled. Each creature in that line must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</action2>

    <trait2>Innate Spellcasting
The hag’s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 13). She can innately cast the following spells:



3/day each: disguise self (including the form of a Medium humanoid), fog cloud</trait2>
    <trait3>Hag Coven
When hags must work together, they form covens, in spite of their selfish natures. A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of whom are equals within the group. However, each of the hags continues to desire more personal power.

	A coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two hags can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever come together, as might happen if two covens come into conflict, the result is usually chaos.</trait3>
    <trait4>Shared Spellcasting (Coven Only)
While all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard's spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves:



• 1st level (4 slots): identify, ray of sickness



• 2nd level (3 slots): hold person, locate object



• 3rd level (3 slots): bestow curse, counterspell, lightning bolt



• 4th level (3 slots): phantasmal killer, polymorph



• 5th level (2 slots): contact other plane, scrying



• 6th level (1 slot): eyebite



	For casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The spell save DC is 12+the hag's Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack bonus is 4+the hag's Intelligence modifier.</trait4>
    <trait5>Hag Eye (Coven Only)
A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.

	A hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.</trait5>
    <trait6>Variant: Death Coven
For a death coven, replace the spell list of the hags' Shared Spellcasting trait with the folllowing spells:



1st level (4 slots): false life, inflict wounds



2nd level (3 slots): gentle repose, ray of enfeeblement



3rd level (3 slots): animate dead, revivify, speak with dead



4th level (3 slots): blight, death ward



5th level (2 slots): contagion, raise dead



6th level (1 slot): circle of death</trait6>
    <trait7>Variant: Nature Coven
For a nature coven, replace the spell list of the hags' Shared Spellcasting trait with the folllowing spells:



1st level (4 slots): entangle, speak with animals



2nd level (3 slots): flaming sphere, moonbeam, spike growth



3rd level (3 slots): call lightning, plant growth



4th level (3 slots): dominate beast, grasping vine



5th level (2 slots): insect plague, tree stride



6th level (1 slot): wall of thorns</trait7>
    <trait8>Variant: Prophecy Coven
For a prophecy coven, replace the spell list of the hags' Shared Spellcasting trait with the folllowing spells:



1st level (4 slots): bane, bless



2nd level (3 slots): augury, detect thoughts



3rd level (3 slots): calirvoyance, dispel magic, nondetection



4th level (3 slots): arcane eye, locate creature



5th level (2 slots): geas, legend lore



6th level (1 slot): true seeing</trait8>
    <action1>Multiattack
The annis makes three attacks: one with her bite and two with her claws.</action1>
    <action2>Bite
Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (3d6+5) piercing damage.</action2>
    <action3>Claw
Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (3d6+5) slashing damage.</action3>

Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 36 (9d6+5) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 15) if it is a Large or smaller creature. Until the grapple ends, the target takes 36 (9d6+5) bludgeoning damage at the start of each of the hag’s turns. The hag can’t make attacks while grappling a creature in this way.



Grappled:

• A grappled creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.



• The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated.



• The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by the thunderwave spell.</action4>

The archdruid can revert to its true form using a bonus action on its turn.

	While in a new form, the archdruid retains its game statistics and ability to speak, but its AC, movement modes, Strength, and Dexterity are replaced by those of the new form, and it gains any special senses, proficiencies, traits, actions, and reactions (except class features, legendary actions, and lair actions) that the new form has but that it lacks. It can cast its spells with verbal or somatic components in its new form.

	The new form’s attacks count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistances and immunity to nonmagical attacks.</action2>

	Artus wields Bookmark, a +3 dagger with additional magical properties. As a bonus action, Artus can activate any one of the following properties while attuned to the dagger, provided he has the weapon drawn:



• Cause a blue gem set into the dagger's pommel to shed bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet, or make the gem go dark.



• Turn the dagger into a compass that, while resting on Artus's palm, points north.



• Cast dimension door from the dagger. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.



• Cast compulsion (save DC 15) from the dagger. The range of the spell increases to 90 feet, but the spell targets only spiders that are beasts. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.</trait2>
    <action1>Multiattack
Artus makes three attacks with [magicitem]Bookmark[magicitem] or his longbow.</action1>
    <action2>Bookmark (+3 Dagger)
Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d4+5) piercing damage.</action2>
    <action3>Longbow
Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d8+2) piercing damage.</action3>
    <action4>Ring of Winter
The Ring of Winter has 12 charges and regains all its expended charges daily at dawn. While attuned to and wearing the ring, Artus can expend the necessary number of charges to activate one of the following properties:



• Artus can expend 1 charge and use the ring to lower the temperature in a 120-foot-radius sphere centered on a point he can see within 300 feet of him. The temperature in that area drops 20 degrees per minute, to a minimum of _30 degrees Fahrenheit. Frost and ice begin to form on surfaces once the temperature drops below 32 degrees. This effect is permanent unless Artus uses the ring to end the effect as an action, at which point the temperature in the area returns to normal at a rate of 10 degrees per minute.



• Artus can cast one of the following spells from the ring (spell save DC 17) by expending the necessary number of charges: Bigby's hand (2 charges; the hand is made of ice, is immune to cold damage, and deals bludgeoning damage instead of force damage as a clenched fist), cone of cold (2 charges), flesh to ice (3 charges; as flesh to stone except that the target turns to solid ice with the density and durability of stone), ice storm (2 charges), Otiluke's otiluke's freezing sphere (3 charges), sleet storm (1 charge), spike growth (1 charge; the spikes are made of ice), or wall of ice (2 charges).



• Artus can expend the necessary number of charges and use the ring to create either an inanimate ice object (2 charges) or an animated ice creature (4 charges). The ice object can't have any moving parts, must be able to fit inside a 10-foot cube, and has the density and durability of metal or stone (Artus's choice). The ice creature must be modeled after a beast with a challenge rating of 2 or less. The ice creature has the same statistics as the beast it models, with the following changes: the creature is a construct with vulnerability to fire damage, immunity to cold and poison damage, and immunity to the following conditions: charmed, exhaustion, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, and poisoned. The ice creature obeys only its creator's commands. The ice object or creature appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of Artus. It melts into a pool of normal water after 24 hours or when it drops to 0 hit points. In extreme heat, it loses 5 (1d10) hit points per minute as it melts. Use the guidelines in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master's Guide to determine the hit points of an inanimate object if they become necessary.</action4>

    <trait2>Assassinate
During its first turn, the assassin has advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn. Any hit the assassin scores against a surprised creature is a critical hit.</trait2>
    <trait3>Evasion
If the assassin is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, the assassin instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.</trait3>
    <trait4>Sneak Attack (1/Turn)
The assassin deals an extra 14 (4d6) damage when it hits a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 ft. of an ally of the assassin that isn't incapacitated and the assassin doesn't have disadvantage on the attack roll.</trait4>

    <trait2>False Appearance
While the assassin vine remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal plant.</trait2>
    <action1>Constrict
Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 20 ft., one creature. Hit: The target takes 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage, and it is grappled (escape DC 14). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and it takes 21 (6d6) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. The vine can constrict only one target at a time.



Grappled:

• A grappled creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.



• The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated.



• The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by the thunderwave spell.



Restrained:

• A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.



• The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.</action1>
    <action2>Entangling Vines
The assassin vine can animate normal vines and roots on the ground in a 15-foot square within 30 feet of it. These plants turn the ground in that area into difficult terrain. A creature in that area when the effect begins must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be restrained by entangling vines and roots. A creature restrained by the plants can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength (Athletics) check, freeing itself on a successful check. The effect ends after 1 minute or when the assassin vine dies or uses Entangling Vines again.



Restrained:

• A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.



• The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.</action2>

    <trait2>Resonant Connection
If the banderhobb has even a tiny piece of a creature or an obect in its possession, such as a lock of hair or a splinter of wood, it knows the most direct route to that creature or object if it is within1 mile of the banderhobb.</trait2>
    <trait3>Shadow Stealth
While in dim light or darkness, the banderhobb can take the Hide action as a bonus action.</trait3>
    <action1>Bite
Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 22 (5d6+5) piercing damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 15) if it is a Large or smaller creature. Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the banderhobb can't use its bite attack or tongue attack on another target.



Grappled:

• A grappled creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.



• The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated.



• The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by the thunderwave spell.



Restrained:

• A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.



• The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.</action1>
    <action2>Tongue
Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (3d6) necrotic damage, and the target must make a DC 15 Strength savng throw. On a failed save, the target is pulled to a space within 5 feet of the banderhobb, which can use a bonus action to make a bite attack against the target.</action2>
    <action3>Swallow
The banderhobb makes a bite attack against a Medium or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. The swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the banderhobb and it takes 10 (3d6) necrotic damage at the start of each of the banderhobb's turns. A creature reduced to 0 hit points in this way stops taking necrotic damage and becomes stable.

	 The banderhobb can have only one target swallowed at a time. While the banderhobb isn't incapacitated, it can regurgitate the creature at any time (no action required) in a space within 5 feet of it. The creature exits prone. If the banderhobb dies, it likewise regurgitates a swallowed creature.



Blinded:

• A blinded creature can't see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.



Restrained:

• A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.



• The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.</action3>
    <action4>Shadow Step
The banderhobb magically teleports up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space of dim light or darkness that it can see. Before or after teleporting, it can make a bite or tongue attack.</action4>

    <trait4>Taunt (2/day)
The bard can use a bonus action on its turn to target one creature within 30 feet of it. If the target can hear the bard, the target must succeed on a DC 12 Charisma saving throw or have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws until the start of the bard's next turn.</trait4>

    <trait2>Shapechanger
The barghest can use its action to polymorph into a Small goblin or back into its true form. Other than its size and speed, its statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. The barghest reverts to its true form if it dies.</trait2>
    <trait3>Fire Banishment
When the barghest starts its turn engulfed in flames that are at least 10 feet high or wide, it must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be instantly banished to Gehenna. Instantaneous bursts of flame (such as a red dragon's breath or a fireball spell) don't have this effect on the barghest.</trait3>
    <trait4>Keen Smell
The barghest has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.</trait4>
    <trait5>Innate Spellcasting
The barghest's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 12). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components::



• At will: levitate, minor illusion, pass without trace



• 1/day each: charm person, dimension door, suggestion</trait5>
    <trait6>Soul Feeding
A barghest can feed on the corpse of a humanoid that it killed that has been dead for less than 10 minutes, devouring both flesh and soul in doing so. This feeding takes at least 1 minute, and it destroys the victim's body. The victim's soul is trapped in the barghest for 24 hours, after which time it is digested. If the barghest dies before the soul is digested, the soul is released.

	While a humanoid's soul is trapped in a barghest, any form of revival that could work has only a 50 percent chance of doing so, freeing the soul from the barghest if it is successful. Once a creature's soul is digested, however, no mortal magic can return that humanoid to life.</trait6>

    <trait2>Petrifying Gaze
If a creature starts its turn within 30 ft. of the basilisk and the two of them can see each other, the basilisk can force the creature to make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw if the basilisk isn't incapacitated. On a failed save, the creature magically begins to turn to stone and is restrained. It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified until freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.

	A creature that isn't surprised can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If it does so, it can't see the basilisk until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If it looks at the basilisk in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.

	If the basilisk sees its reflection within 30 ft. of it in bright light, it mistakes itself for a rival and targets itself with its gaze.



Petrified:

• A petrified creature is transformed, along with any nonmagical object it is wearing or carrying, into a solid inanimate substance (usually stone). Its weight increases by a factor of ten, and it ceases aging.



• The creature is incapacitated (meaning it can't take actions or reactions), can't move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.



• The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.



• The creature has resistance to all damage.



• The creature is immune to poison and disease, although a poison or disease already in its system is suspended, not neutralized.



Restrained:

• A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.



• The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.</trait2>

Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 (1d8+2) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. While poisoned in this way, the target can't regain hit points. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.



Poisoned:

• A poisoned creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.</action2>
    <action3>Glaive
Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d10+3) slashing damage. If the target is a creature other than an undead or a construct, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or lose 5 (1d10) hit points at the start of each of its turns due to an infernal wound. Each time the devil hits the wounded target with this attack, the damage dealt by the wound increases by 5 (1d10). Any creature can take an action to stanch the wound with a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Medicine) check. The wound also closes if the target receives magical healing.</action3>

    <action1>Multiattack
The behir makes two attacks: one with its bite and one to constrict.</action1>
    <action2>Bite
Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 22 (3d10+6) piercing damage.</action2>
    <action3>Constrict
Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one Large or smaller creature. Hit: 17 (2d10+6) bludgeoning damage plus 17 (2d10+6) slashing damage. The target is grappled (escape DC 16) if the behir isn't already constricting a creature, and the target is restrained until this grapple ends.



Grappled:

• A grappled creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.



• The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated.



• The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by the thunderwave spell.



Restrained:

• A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.



• The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.</action3>
    <action4>Lightning Breath (Recharge 5-6)
The behir exhales a line of lightning that is 20 ft. long and 5 ft. wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 66 (12d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</action4>
    <action5>Swallow
The behir makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller target it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is also swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the target is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the behir, and it takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the behir's turns. A behir can have only one creature swallowed at a time.

	If the behir takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from the swallowed creature, the behir must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the creature, which falls prone in a space within 10 ft. of the behir. If the behir dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 15 ft. of movement, exiting prone.



Blinded:

• A blinded creature can't see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.



Prone:

• A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.



• The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.



• An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.



Restrained:

• A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.



• The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.</action5>

    <trait2>Antimagic Cone
The beholder's central eye creates an area of antimagic, as in the antimagic field spell, in a 150-foot cone. At the start of each of its turns, the beholder decides which way the cone faces and whether the cone is active. The area works against the beholder's own eye rays.</trait2>
    <action1>Bite
Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (4d6) piercing damage.</action1>
    <action2>Eye Rays
The beholder shoots three of the following magical eye rays at random (reroll duplicates), choosing one to three targets it can see within 120 ft. of it:

	1. Charm Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the beholder for 1 hour, or until the beholder harms the creature.

	2. Paralyzing Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

	3. Fear Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

	4. Slowing Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target's speed is halved for 1 minute. In addition, the creature can't take reactions, and it can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

	5. Enervation Ray. The targeted creature must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

	6. Telekinetic Ray. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or the beholder moves it up to 30 ft. in any direction. It is restrained by the ray's telekinetic grip until the start of the beholder's next turn or until the beholder is incapacitated.

	If the target is an object weighing 300 pounds or less that isn't being worn or carried, it is moved up to 30 ft. in any direction. The beholder can also exert fine control on objects with this ray, such as manipulating a simple tool or opening a door or a container.

	7. Sleep Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or fall asleep and remain unconscious for 1 minute. The target awakens if it takes damage or another creature takes an action to wake it. This ray has no effect on constructs and undead.

	8. Petrification Ray. The targeted creature must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature begins to turn to stone and is restrained. It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified until freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.

	9. Disintegration Ray. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 45 (10d8) force damage. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, its body becomes a pile of fine gray dust.

	If the target is a Large or smaller nonmagical object or creation of magical force, it is disintegrated without a saving throw. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation of magical force, this ray disintegrates a 10-foot cube of it.

	10. Death Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 55 (10d10) necrotic damage. The target dies if the ray reduces it to 0 hit points.

    <trait2>Death Throes
When Belaphoss dies, he explodes, and each creature within 30 feet of him must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 70 (20d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The explosion ignites flammable objects in that area that aren't being worn or carried, and it destroys Belaphoss's weapons.</trait2>
    <trait3>Fire Aura
At the start of each of Belaphoss's turns, each creature within 5 feet of him takes 10 (3d6) fire damage, and flammable objects in the aura that aren't being worn or carried ignite. A creature that touches Belpahoss or hits him with a melee attack while within 5 feet of him takes 10 (3d6) fire damage.</trait3>
    <trait4>Magic Resistance
Belaphoss has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</trait4>
    <trait5>Magic Weapon
Belaphoss's weapon attacks are magical.</trait5>
    <action1>Multiattack
Belaphoss makes two attacks: one with his greataxe and one with his whip.</action1>
    <action2>Greataxe
Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 24 (3d10+9) slashing dmage plus 13 (3d8) fire damage.  If Belaphoss scores a critical hit, he rolls damage dice three times, instead of twice.</action2>
    <action3>Whip
Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d6+8) slashing damage plus 10 (3d6) fire damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 25 feet toward Belaphoss.</action3>
    <action4>Abyssal Storm (Recharge 5-6)
Belaphoss surrounds himself with explosive fire that fills a 30-foot sphere centered on him and spreads around corners.  Each creature in the fire must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 28 (8d6) fire damage and 28 (8d6) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. Belaphoss is immune to this damage. Objects in the area are subject to it, and the fire ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.</action4>
    <action5>Teleport
Belaphoss magically teleports, along with any equipment he is wearing or carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space he can see.</action5>
    <action6>Winged Barrage
Belaphoss beats his wings. Each creature in a 20-foot cube originating from him must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw.  On a failure, a target takes 29 (6d6+9) bludgeoning damage and is pushed 20 feet away from Belaphoss. On a success, the target takes half the bludgeoning damage and isn't pushed. Belaphoss can then fly up to half his flying speed.</action6>

    <trait2>Graystaff Magic
The hag carries a graystaff, a length of gray wood that is a focus for her inner power. She can ride the staff as if it were a broom of flying. While holding the staff, she can cast additional spells with her Innate Spellcasting trait (these spells are marked with an asterisk). If the staff is lost or destroyed, the hag must craft another, which takes a year and a day. Only a bheur hag can use a graystaff.</trait2>
    <trait3>Ice Walk
The hag can move across and climb icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check. Additionally, difficult terrain composed of ice or snow doesn’t cost her extra moment.</trait3>
    <trait4>Innate Spellcasting
The hag’s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks). She can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:



At will: hold person,* ray of frost



3/day each: cone of cold,* ice storm*, wall of ice*



1/day each: control weather</trait4>
    <trait5>Hag Coven
When hags must work together, they form covens, in spite of their selfish natures. A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of whom are equals within the group. However, each of the hags continues to desire more personal power.

	A coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two hags can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever come together, as might happen if two covens come into conflict, the result is usually chaos.</trait5>
    <trait6>Shared Spellcasting (Coven Only)
While all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard's spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves:



• 1st level (4 slots): identify, ray of sickness



• 2nd level (3 slots): hold person, locate object



• 3rd level (3 slots): bestow curse, counterspell, lightning bolt



• 4th level (3 slots): phantasmal killer, polymorph



• 5th level (2 slots): contact other plane, scrying



• 6th level (1 slot): eyebite



	For casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The spell save DC is 12+the hag's Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack bonus is 4+the hag's Intelligence modifier.</trait6>
    <trait7>Hag Eye (Coven Only)
A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.

	A hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.</trait7>
    <trait8>Variant: Death Coven
For a death coven, replace the spell list of the hags' Shared Spellcasting trait with the folllowing spells:



1st level (4 slots): false life, inflict wounds



2nd level (3 slots): gentle repose, ray of enfeeblement



3rd level (3 slots): animate dead, revivify, speak with dead



4th level (3 slots): blight, death ward



5th level (2 slots): contagion, raise dead



6th level (1 slot): circle of death</trait8>
    <trait9>Variant: Nature Coven
For a nature coven, replace the spell list of the hags' Shared Spellcasting trait with the folllowing spells:



1st level (4 slots): entangle, speak with animals



2nd level (3 slots): flaming sphere, moonbeam, spike growth



3rd level (3 slots): call lightning, plant growth



4th level (3 slots): dominate beast, grasping vine



5th level (2 slots): insect plague, tree stride



6th level (1 slot): wall of thorns</trait9>
    <trait10>Variant: Prophecy Coven
For a prophecy coven, replace the spell list of the hags' Shared Spellcasting trait with the folllowing spells:



1st level (4 slots): bane, bless



2nd level (3 slots): augury, detect thoughts



3rd level (3 slots): calirvoyance, dispel magic, nondetection



4th level (3 slots): arcane eye, locate creature



5th level (2 slots): geas, legend lore



6th level (1 slot): true seeing</trait10>
    <action1>Slam
Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit:10 (2d8+1) bludgeoning damage plus 3 (1d6) cold damage.</action1>
    <action2>Maddening Feast
The hag feasts on the corpse of one enemy within 5 feet of her that died within the past minute. Each creature of the hag’s choice that is within 60 feet of her and able to see her must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of her for 1 minute. While frightened in this way, a creature is incapacitated, can't understand what others say, can't read, and speaks only in gibberish; the DM controls the creature’s movement, which is erratic. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the hag’s Maddening Feast for the next 24 hours.



Frightened:

• A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight.



• The creature can't willingly move closer to the source of its fear.



Incapacitated:

• An incapacitated creature can't take actions or reactions.</action2>

    <trait3>Regeneration
The slaad regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point.</trait3>
    <trait4>Variant: Control Gem
Implanted in the slaad's brain is a magic control gem. The slaad must obey whoever possesses the gem and is immune to being charmed while so controlled.

	Certain spells can be used to acquire the gem. If the slaad fails its saving throw against imprisonment, the spell can transfer the gem to the spellcaster's open hand, instead of imprisoning the slaad. A wish spell, if cast in the slaad's presence, can be worded to acquire the gem.

	A greater restoration spell cast on the slaad destroys the gem without harming the slaad.

	Someone who is proficient in Wisdom (Medicine) can remove the gem from an incapacitated slaad. Each try requires 1 minute of uninterrupted work and a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Medicine) check. Each failed attempt deals 22 (4d10) psychic damage to the slaad.</trait4>
    <action1>Multiattack
The slaad makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.</action1>

Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6+5) slashing damage. If the target is a humanoid, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be infected with a disease called chaos phage. While infected, the target can't regain hit points, and its hit point maximum is reduced by 10 (3d6) every 24 hours. If the disease reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target instantly transforms into a red slaad or, if it has the ability to cast spells of 3rd level or higher, a green slaad. Only a wish spell can reverse the transformation.</action3>

If the boar moves at least 20 ft. straight toward a target and then hits it with a tusk attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 3 (1d6) slashing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 11 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.



Prone:

• A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.



• The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.

    <trait2>Aura of Annihilation
The bodak can activate or deactivate this feature as a bonus action. While active, the aura deals 5 necrotic damage to any creature that ends its turn within 30 feet of the bodak. Undead and fiends ignore this effect.</trait2>
    <trait3>Death Gaze
When a creature that can see the bodak’s eyes starts its turn within 30 feet of the bodak, the bodak can force it to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw if the bodak isn't incapacitated and can see the creature. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is reduced to 0 hit points, unless it is immune to the frightened condition. Otherwise, a creature takes 16 (3d10) psychic damage on a failed save.

	Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so. it has disadvantage on attack rolls against the bodak until the start of its next turn. If the creature looks at the bodak in the meantime, it must immediately make the saving throw.</trait3>

    <trait2>Boggle Oil
The boggle excretes nonflammable oil from its pores. The boggle chooses whether the oil is slippery or sticky and can change the oil on its skin from one consistency to another as a bonus action.



Slippery Oil: While coated in slippery oil, the boggle gains advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks made to escape bonds, squeeze through narrow spaces, and end grapples.



Sticky Oil: While coated in sticky oil, the boggle gains advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks made to grapple and any ability check made to maintain a hold on another creature, a surface, or an object. The boggle can also climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.</trait2>
    <trait3>Dimensional Rift
As a bonus action, the boggle can create an invisible and immobile rift within an opening or frame it can see within 5 feet of it, provided that the space is no bigger than 10 feet on any side. The dimensional rift bridges the distance between that space and any point within 30 feet of it that the boggle can see or specify by distance and direction (such as “30 feet straight up”). While next to the rift, the boggle can see through it and is considered to be next to the destination as well, and anything the boggle puts through the rift (including a portion of its body) emerges at the destination.

    <action1>Hallucination Spores
The bridesmaid ejects spores at one creature it can see within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. While poisoned in this way, the target is incapacitated. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

    <action2>Infestation Spores (1/Day)
The bridesmaid releases spores that burst out in a cloud that fills a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on it, and the cloud lingers for 1 minute. Any flesh-and-blood creature in the cloud when it appears, or that enters it later, must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the creature can't be infected by these spores for 24 hours. On a failed save, the creature is infected with a disease called the spores of Zuggtmoy and also gains a random form of indefinite madness (determined by rolling on the Madness of Zuggtmoy table in appendix D) that lasts until the creature is cured of the disease or dies. While infected in this way, the creature can't be reinfected, and it must be repeat the saving throw at the end of every 24 hours, ending the infection on a success. On a failure, the infected creature's body is slowly taken over by fungal growth, and after three such failed saves, the creature dies and is reanimated as a spore servant if it's a type of creature that can be (see the "Myconids" entry in the Monster Manual).</action2>

The bulette's long jump is up to 30 ft. and its high jump is up to 15 ft., with or without a running start.</trait2>
    <action1>Bite
Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 30 (4d12+4) piercing damage.</action1>
    <action2>Deadly Leap
If the bulette jumps at least 15 ft. as part of its movement, it can then use this action to land on its ft. in a space that contains one or more other creatures. Each of those creatures must succeed on a DC 16 Strength or Dexterity saving throw (target's choice) or be knocked prone and take 14 (3d6+4) bludgeoning damage plus 14 (3d6+4) slashing damage. On a successful save, the creature takes only half the damage, isn't knocked prone, and is pushed 5 ft. out of the bulette's space into an unoccupied space of the creature's choice. If no unoccupied space is within range, the creature instead falls prone in the bulette's space.



Prone:

• A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.



• The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.



• An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.</action2>

If the target suffers any harm from the cambion or another creature or receives a suicidal command from the cambion, the target can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful, or if the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the cambion's Fiendish Charm for the next 24 hours.



Charmed:

• A charmed creature can't attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects.



• The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature.</action4>

    <trait2>Adhesive Filament
The cave fisher can use its action to extend a sticky filament up to 60 feet, and the filament adheres to anything that touches it. A creature adhered to the filament is grappled by the cave fisher (escape DC 13), and ability checks made to escape this grapple have disadvantage. The filament can be attacked (AC 15; 5 hit points; immunity to poison and psychic damage), but a weapon that fails to sever it becomes stuck to it, requiring an action and a successful DC 13 Strength check to pull free. Destroying the filament causes no damage to the cave fisher, which can extrude a replacement filament on its next turn



Grappled:

• A grappled creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.



• The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated.



• The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by the thunderwave spell.</trait2>

Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 it, one target. Hit: 10 (2d6+3) slashing damage.</action2>
    <action3>Filament
One creature grappled by the cave fisher’s adhesive filament must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw, provided that the target weighs 200 pounds or less. On a failure, the target is pulled into an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the cave fisher, and the cave fisher makes a claw attack against it as a bonus action. Reeling up the target releases anyone else who was attached to the filament. Until the grapple ends on the target, the cave fisher can’t extrude another filament.</action3>

    <trait2>Undead Nature
A mummy doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.</trait2>
    <trait3>Charge
If the centaur mummy moves at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a pike attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 10 (3d6) piercing damage.</trait3>
    <action1>Multiattack
The centaur mummy makes two melee attacks, one with its pike and one with its hooves, or it attacks with its pike and uses Dreadful Glare.</action1>
    <action2>Pike
Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (1d10 + 5) piercing damage.</action2>
    <action3>Hooves
Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with mummy rot. The cursed target can't regain hit points, and its hit point maximum decreases by 10 (3d6) for every 24 hours that elapse. If the curse reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and its body turns to dust. The curse lasts until removed by the remove curse spell or similar magic.</action3>
    <action4>Dreadful Glare
The centaur mummy targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. If the target can see the mummy, the target must succeed on a DC 12 wisdom saving throw against this magic or become frightened until the end of the mummy's next turn. If the target fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it is also paralyzed for the same duration. A target that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to the Dreadful Glare of all mummies (but not mummy lords) for tne next 24 hours.



Frightened:

• A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight.



• The creature can't willingly move closer to the source of its fear.



Paralyzed:

• A paralyzed creature is incapacitated, meaning it can't take actions or reactions, and can't move or speak.



• The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.



• Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.</action4>

Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6+4) slashing damage. The target is grappled (escape DC 14) if the devil isn't already grappling a creature. Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained and takes 7 (2d6) piercing damage at the start of each of its turns.



Grappled:

• A grappled creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.



• The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated.



• The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by the thunderwave spell.

Up to four chains the devil can see within 60 feet of it magically sprout razor-edged barbs and animate under the devil's control, provided that the chains aren't being worn or carried.

	Each animated chain is an object with AC 20, 20 hit points, resistance to piercing damage, and immunity to psychic and thunder damage. When the devil uses Multiattack on its turn, it can use each animated chain to make one additional chain attack. An animated chain can grapple one creature of its own but can't make attacks while grappling. An animated chain reverts to its inanimate state if reduced to 0 hit points or if the devil is incapacitated or dies.</action3>

    <trait2>Mushroom Portal
The chamberlain counts as a mushroom for the Fungus Stride feature of the bridesmaid of Zuggtmoy.</trait2>
    <trait3>Poison Spores
Whenever the chamberlain takes damage, it releases a cloud of spores. Creatures within 5 feet of the chamberlain when this happens must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at t ehe end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

    <action1>Multiattack
The chamberlain makes two slam attacks.</action1>
    <action2>Slam
Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6+3) bludgeoning damage.</action2>
    <action3>Infestation Spores (1/Day)
The chamberlain releases spores that burst out in a cloud that fills a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on it, and the cloud lingers for 1 minute. Any flesh-and-blood creature in the cloud when it appears, or that enters it later, must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the creature can't be infected by these spores for 24 hours. On a failed save, the creature is infected with a disease called the spores of Zuggtmoy and also gains a random form of indefinite madness (determined by rolling on the Madness of Zuggtmoy table in appendix D) that lasts until the creature is cured of the disease or dies. While infected in this way, the creature can't be reinfected, and it must be repeat the saving throw at the end of every 24 hours, ending the infection on a success. On a failure, the infected creature's body is slowly taken over by fungal growth, and after three such failed saves, the creature dies and is reanimated as a spore servant if it's a type of creature that can be (see the "Myconids" entry in the Monster Manual).</action3>

    <trait2>Drone
The chasme produces a horrid droning sound to which demons are immune. Any other creature that starts its turn with in 30 feet of the chasme must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious for 10 minutes.

    <action2>Variant: Summon Demon (1/Day)
The demon chooses what to summon and attempts a magical summoning.

	A chasme has a 30 percent chance of summoning one chasme.

	A summoned demon appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of its summoner, acts as an ally of its summoner, and can't summon other demons. It remains for 1 minute, until it or its summoner dies, or until its summoner dismisses it as an action.</action2>

    <trait2>Evasion
When the chwinga is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.</trait2>
    <trait3>Innate Spellcasting
The chwinga's innate spellcasting ability is Wisdom. It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material or verbal components:



At will: druidcraft, guidance, pass without trace, resistance</trait3>
    <action1>Magical Gift (1/Day)
The chwinga targets a humanoid it can see within 5 feet of it. The target gains a supernatural charm of the DM's choice. See chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide for more information on supernatural charms.</action1>
    <action2>Natural Shelter
The chwinga magically takes shelter inside a rock, a living plant, or a natural source of fresh water in its space. The chwinga can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect while inside this shelter, and the shelter doesn't impair the chwinga's blindsight. The chwinga can use its action to emerge from a shelter. If its shelter is destroyed, the chwinga is forced out and appears in the shelter's space, but is otherwise unharmed.</action2>

    <trait2>Acid Absorption
Whenever the golem is subjected to acid damage, it takes no damage and instead regains a number of hit points equal to the acid damage dealt.</trait2>
    <trait3>Berserk
Whenever the golem starts its turn with 60 hit points or fewer, roll a d6. On a 6, the golem goes berserk. On each of its turns while berserk, the golem attacks the nearest creature it can see. If no creature is near enough to move to and attack, the golem attacks an object, with preference for an object smaller than itself. Once the golem goes berserk, it continues to do so until it is destroyed or regains all its hit points.</trait3>

Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d10+5) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have its hit point maximum reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. The target dies if this attack reduces its hit point maximum to 0. The reduction lasts until removed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.</action2>
    <action3>Haste (Recharge 5-6)
Until the end of its next turn, the golem magically gains a +2 bonus to its AC, has advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and can use its slam attack as a bonus action.</action3>

    <trait2>Damage Transfer
While attached to a creature, the cloaker takes only half the damage dealt to it (rounded down). and that creature takes the other half.</trait2>
    <trait3>False Appearance
While the cloaker remains motionless without its underside exposed, it is indistinguishable from a dark leather cloak.</trait3>
    <trait4>Light Sensitivity
While in bright light, the cloaker has disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.</trait4>
    <action1>Multiattack
The cloaker makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its tail.</action1>
    <action2>Bite
Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 10 (2d6+3) piercing damage, and if the target is Large or smaller, the cloaker attaches to it. If the cloaker has advantage against the target, the cloaker attaches to the target's head, and the target is blinded and unable to breathe while the cloaker is attached. While attached, the cloaker can make this attack only against the target and has advantage on the attack roll. The cloaker can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement. A creature, including the target, can take its action to detach the cloaker by succeeding on a DC 16 Strength check.



Blinded:

• A blinded creature can't see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.</action2>
    <action3>Tail
Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. Hit: 7 (1d8+3) slashing damage.</action3>
    <action4>Moan
Each creature within 60 feet of the cloaker that can hear its moan and that isn't an aberration must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened until the end of the cloaker's next turn. If a creature's saving throw is successful, the creature is immune to the cloaker's moan for the next 24 hours.



Frightened:

• A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight.



• The creature can't willingly move closer to the source of its fear.</action4>
    <action5>Phantasms (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest)
The cloaker magically creates three illusory duplicates of itself if it isn't in bright light. The duplicates move with it and mimic its actions, shifting position so as to make it impossible to track which cloaker is the real one. If the cloaker is ever in an area of bright light, the duplicates disappear.

	Whenever any creature targets the cloaker with an attack or a harmful spell while a duplicate remains, that creature rolls randomly to determine whether it targets the cloaker or one of the duplicates. A creature is unaffected by this magical effect if it can't see or if it relies on senses other than sight.

	A duplicate has the cloaker's AC and uses its saving throws. If an attack hits a duplicate, or if a duplicate fails a saving throw against an effect that deals damage, the duplicate disappears.</action5>

    <action4>Variant: Fling
The giant tries to throw a Small or Medium creature within 10 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or be hurled up to 60 feet horizontally in a direction of the giant's choice and land prone, taking 1d8 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown.



Storm King's Thunder, p. 245</action4>
    <action5>Variant: Wind Aura
A magical aura of wind surrounds the giant. The aura is a 10-foot-radius sphere that lasts as long as the giant maintains concentration on it (as if concentrating on a spell). While the aura is in effect, the giant gains a +2 bonus to its AC against ranged weapon attacks, and all open flames within the aura are extinguished unless they are magical.

Grappled:

• A grappled creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.



• The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated.



• The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by the thunderwave spell.



Restrained:

• A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.



• The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.</action2>
    <action3>Change Shape
The couatl magically polymorphs into a humanoid or beast that has a challenge rating equal to or less than its own, or back into its true form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the couatl's choice).

	In a new form, the couatl retains its game statistics and ability to speak, but its AC, movement modes, Strength, Dexterity, and other actions are replaced by those of the new form, and it gains any statistics and capabilities (except class features, legendary actions, and lair actions) that the new form has but that it lacks. If the new form has a bite attack, the couatl can use its bite in that form.</action3>

    <trait2>Earth Glide
The dao can burrow through nonmagical, unworked earth and stone. While doing so, the dao doesn't disturb the material it moves through.</trait2>
    <trait3>Elemental Demise
If the dao dies, its body disintegrates into crystalline powder, leaving behind only equipment the dao was wearing or carrying.</trait3>
    <trait4>Innate Spellcasting
The dao's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

	At will: detect evil and good, detect magic, stone shape

	3/day each: passwall, move earth, tongues

	1/day each: conjure elemental (earth elemental only), gaseous form, invisibility, phantasmal killer, plane shift, wall of stone</trait4>
    <trait5>Sure-Footed
The dao has advantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws made against effects that would knock it prone.</trait5>
    <trait6>Variant: Genie Powers
Genies have a variety of magical capabilities, including spells. A few have even greater powers that allow them to alter their appearance or the nature of reality.



	Disguises.

	Some genies can veil themselves in illusion to pass as other similarly shaped creatures. Such genies can innately cast the disguise self spell at will, often with a longer duration than is normal for that spell. Mightier genies can cast the true polymorph spell one to three times per day, possibly with a longer duration than normal. Such genies can change only their own shape, but a rare few can use the spell on other creatures and objects as well.

	Wishes.

	The genie power to grant wishes is legendary among mortals. Only the most potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A particular genie that has this power can grant one to three wishes to a creature that isn't a genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can't grant wishes again for some amount of time (usually 1 year). and cosmic law dictates that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that creature's existence.

	To be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the wish spell on the creature's behalf to bring about the effect. Depending on the genie's nature, the genie might try to pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting the wish's poor wording. The perversion of the wording is usually crafted to be to the genie's benefit.</trait6>
    <action1>Multiattack
The Dao makes two fist attacks or two maul attacks.</action1>
    <action2>Fist
Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d8+6) bludgeoning damage.</action2>
    <action3>Maul
Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 20 (4d6+6) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Huge or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 18 Strength check or be knocked prone.



Prone:

• A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.



• The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.



• An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.</action3>

    <trait2>Death Flash
When the darkling dies, nonmagical light flashes out from it in a 10-foot radius as its body and possessions, other than metal or magic objects, burn to ash. Any creature in that area and able to see the bright light must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of the creature’s next turn.



Blinded:

• A blinded creature can't see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.</trait2>

When the darkling elder dies, magical light flashes out from it in a 10-foot radius as its body and possessions, other than metal or magic objects, burn to ash. Any creature in that area must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 7 (2d6) radiant damage and, if the creature can see the light, is blinded until the end of its next turn. If the saving throw is successful, the creature takes half the damage and isn’t blinded.

Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 (1d6+3) bludgeoning damage, and the darkmantle attaches to the target. If the target is Medium or smaller and the darkmantle has advantage on the attack roll, it attaches by engulfing the target's head, and the target is also blinded and unable to breathe while the darkmantle is attached in this way.

	While attached to the target, the darkmantle can attack no other creature except the target but has advantage on its attack rolls. The darkmantle's speed also becomes 0, it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed, and it moves with the target.

	A creature can detach the darkmantle by making a successful DC 13 Strength check as an action. On its turn, the darkmantle can detach itself from the target by using 5 feet of movement.

A 15-foot radius of magical darkness extends out from the darkmantle, moves with it, and spreads around corners. The darkness lasts as long as the darkmantle maintains concentration, up to 10 minutes (as if concentrating on a spell). Darkvision can't penetrate this darkness, and no natural light can illuminate it. If any of the darkness overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell creating the light is dispelled.</action2>

The death kiss makes three tentacle attacks. Up to three of these attacks can be replaced by Blood Drain, one replacement per tentacle grappling a creature</action1>
    <action2>Tentacle
Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (3d6+4) piercing damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 14) if it is a Huge or smaller creature. Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the death kiss can't use the same tentacle on another target. The death kiss has ten tentacles.



Grappled:

• A grappled creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.

The slaad can use its action to polymorph into a Small or Medium humanoid, or back into its true form. Its statistics, other than its size, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.</trait2>
    <trait3>Innate Spellcasting
The slaad's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 15, +7 to hit with spell attacks). The slaad can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:



	At will: detect magic, detect thoughts, invisibility (self only), mage hand, major image

	2/day each: fear, fireball, fly, tongues

	1/day each: cloudkill, plane shift</trait3>
    <trait4>Magic Resistance
The slaad has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects</trait4>
    <trait5>Magic Weapons
The slaad's weapon attacks are magical.</trait5>
    <trait6>Regeneration
The slaad regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point.</trait6>
    <trait7>Variant: Control Gem
Implanted in the slaad's brain is a magic control gem. The slaad must obey whoever possesses the gem and is immune to being charmed while so controlled.

	Certain spells can be used to acquire the gem. If the slaad fails its saving throw against imprisonment, the spell can transfer the gem to the spellcaster's open hand, instead of imprisoning the slaad. A wish spell, if cast in the slaad's presence, can be worded to acquire the gem.

	A greater restoration spell cast on the slaad destroys the gem without harming the slaad.

	Someone who is proficient in Wisdom (Medicine) can remove the gem from an incapacitated slaad. Each try requires 1 minute of uninterrupted work and a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Medicine) check. Each failed attempt deals 22 (4d10) psychic damage to the slaad.</trait7>

    <trait2>Negative Energy Cone
The death tyrant's central eye emits an invisible, magical 150-foot cone of negative energy. At the start of each of its turns, the tyrant decides which way the cone faces and whether the cone is active.

	Any creature in that area can't regain hit points. Any humanoid that dies there becomes a zombie under the tyrant's command. The dead humanoid retains its place in the initiative order and animates at the start of its next turn, provided that its body hasn't been completely destroyed.</trait2>

Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (4d6) piercing damage.</action1>
    <action2>Eye Rays
The death tyrant shoots three of the following magical eye rays at random (reroll duplicates), choosing one to three targets it can see within 120 ft. of it:

	1. Charm Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the death tyrant for 1 hour, or until the death tyrant harms the creature.

	2. Paralyzing Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

	3. Fear Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

	4. Slowing Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target's speed is halved for 1 minute. In addition, the creature can't take reactions, and it can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

	5. Enervation Ray. The targeted creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

	6. Telekinetic Ray. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or the death tyrant moves it up to 30 ft. in any direction. It is restrained by the ray's telekinetic grip until the start of the death tyrant's next turn or until the death tyrant is incapacitated.

	If the target is an object weighing 300 pounds or less that isn't being worn or carried, it is moved up to 30 ft. in any direction. The death tyrant can also exert fine control on objects with this ray, such as manipulating a simple tool or opening a door or a container.

	7. Sleep Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or fall asleep and remain unconscious for 1 minute. The target awakens if it takes damage or another creature takes an action to wake it. This ray has no effect on constructs and undead.

	8. Petrification Ray. The targeted creature must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature begins to turn to stone and is restrained. It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified until freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.

	9. Disintegration Ray. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or take 45 (10d8) force damage. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, its body becomes a pile of fine gray dust.

	If the target is a Large or smaller nonmagical object or creation of magical force, it is disintegrated without a saving throw. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation of magical force, this ray disintegrates a 10-foot cube of it.

	10. Death Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or take 55 (10d10) necrotic damage. The target dies if the ray reduces it to 0 hit points.

    <action2>Tentacle
Melee Weapon Attack: +17 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 35 (4d12+9) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 23 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0.</action2>
    <action3>Gaze
Demogorgon turns his magical gaze toward one creature that he can see within 120 feet of him. That target must make a DC 23 Wisdom saving throw. Unless the target is incapacitated, it can avert its eyes to avoid the gaze and to automatically succeed on the save. If the target does so, it can't see Demogorgon until the start of his next turn. If the target looks at him in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.

	If the target fails the save, the target suffers one of the following effects of Demogorgon's choice or at random:

	1. Beguiling Gaze: The target is stunned until the start of Demogorgon's next turn or until Demogorgon is no longer within line of sight.

	2. Hypnotic Gaze: The target is charmed by Demogorgon until the start of Demogorgon's next turn. Demogorgon chooses how the charmed target uses its actions, reactions, and movement. Because this gaze requires Demogorgon to focus both heads on the target, he can't use his Maddening Gaze legendary action until the start of his next turn.

	3. Insanity Gaze: The target suffers the effect of the confusion spell without making a saving throw. The effect lasts until the start of Demogorgon's next turn. Demogorgon doesn't need to concentrate on the spell.



Charmed:

• A charmed creature can't attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects.



• The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature.



Stunned:

• A stunned creature is incapacitated, meaning it can't take actions or reactions, can't move, and can speak only falteringly.

The deva magically polymorphs into a humanoid or beast that has a challenge rating equal to or less than its own, or back into its true form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the deva's choice).

	In a new form, the deva retains its game statistics and ability to speak, but its AC, movement modes, Strength, Dexterity, and special senses are replaced by those of the new form, and it gains any statistics and capabilities (except class features, legendary actions, and lair actions) that the new form has but that it lacks.</action4>

Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6+5) slashing damage plus 21 (6d6) necrotic damage.</action2>
    <action3>Imprison Soul
The devourer chooses a living humanoid with 0 hit points that it can see within 30 feet of it. That creature is teleported inside the devourer’s ribcage and imprisoned there. A creature imprisoned in this manner has disadvantage on death saving throws. If it dies while imprisoned, the devourer regains 25 hit points, immediately recharges Soul Rend, and gains an additional action on its next turn. Additionally, at the start of its next turn, the devourer regurgitates the slain creature as a bonus action, and the creature becomes an undead. If the victim had 2 or fewer Hit Dice, it becomes a zombie. if it had 3 to 5 Hit Dice, it becomes a ghoul. Otherwise, it becomes a wight. A devourer can imprison only one creature at a time.</action3>
    <action4>Soul Rend (Recharge 6)
The devourer creates a vortex of life-draining energy in a 20-foot radius centered on itself. Each humanoid in that area must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 44 (8d10) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Increase the damage by 10 for each living humanoid with 0 hit points in that area.</action4>

    <trait2>Elemental Demise
If the djinni dies, its body disintegrates into a warm breeze, leaving behind only equipment the djinni was wearing or carrying.</trait2>
    <trait3>Innate Spellcasting
The djinni's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 17, +9 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:



	At will: detect evil and good, detect magic, thunderwave 3/day each: create food and water (can create wine instead of water), tongues, wind walk

	1/day each: conjure elemental (air elemental only), creation, gaseous form, invisibility, major image, plane shift</trait3>
    <trait4>Variant: Genie Powers
Genies have a variety of magical capabilities, including spells. A few have even greater powers that allow them to alter their appearance or the nature of reality.



	Disguises.

	Some genies can veil themselves in illusion to pass as other similarly shaped creatures. Such genies can innately cast the disguise self spell at will, often with a longer duration than is normal for that spell. Mightier genies can cast the true polymorph spell one to three times per day, possibly with a longer duration than normal. Such genies can change only their own shape, but a rare few can use the spell on other creatures and objects as well.

	Wishes.

	The genie power to grant wishes is legendary among mortals. Only the most potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A particular genie that has this power can grant one to three wishes to a creature that isn't a genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can't grant wishes again for some amount of time (usually 1 year). and cosmic law dictates that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that creature's existence.

	To be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the wish spell on the creature's behalf to bring about the effect. Depending on the genie's nature, the genie might try to pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting the wish's poor wording. The perversion of the wording is usually crafted to be to the genie's benefit.</trait4>
    <action1>Multiattack
The djinni makes three scimitar attacks.</action1>
    <action2>Scimitar
Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6+5) slashing damage plus 3 (1d6) lightning or thunder damage (djinni's choice).</action2>
    <action3>Create Whirlwind
A 5-foot-radius, 30-foot-tall cylinder of swirling air magically forms on a point the djinni can see within 120 feet of it. The whirlwind lasts as long as the djinni maintains concentration (as if concentrating on a spell). Any creature but the djinni that enters the whirlwind must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be restrained by it. The djinni can move the whirlwind up to 60 feet as an action, and creatures restrained by the whirlwind move with it. The whirlwind ends if the djinni loses sight of it.

	A creature can use its action to free a creature restrained by the whirlwind, including itself, by succeeding on a DC 18 Strength check. If the check succeeds, the creature is no longer restrained and moves to the nearest space outside the whirlwind.



Restrained:

• A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.



• The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.</action3>

Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the dryad dies, is on a different plane of existence from the target, or ends the effect as a bonus action. If a target's saving throw is successful, the target is immune to the dryad's Fey Charm for the next 24 hours.

	The dryad can have no more than one humanoid and up to three beasts charmed at a time.

    <trait3>Innate Spellcasting
The efreeti's innate spell casting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 15, +7 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:



	At will: detect magic

	3/day: enlarge/reduce, tongues

	1/day each: conjure elemental (fire elemental only), gaseous form, invisibility, major image, plane shift, wall of fire</trait3>
    <trait4>Variant: Genie Powers
Genies have a variety of magical capabilities, including spells. A few have even greater powers that allow them to alter their appearance or the nature of reality.



	Disguises.

	Some genies can veil themselves in illusion to pass as other similarly shaped creatures. Such genies can innately cast the disguise self spell at will, often with a longer duration than is normal for that spell. Mightier genies can cast the true polymorph spell one to three times per day, possibly with a longer duration than normal. Such genies can change only their own shape, but a rare few can use the spell on other creatures and objects as well.

	Wishes.

	The genie power to grant wishes is legendary among mortals. Only the most potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A particular genie that has this power can grant one to three wishes to a creature that isn't a genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can't grant wishes again for some amount of time (usually 1 year). and cosmic law dictates that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that creature's existence.

	To be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the wish spell on the creature's behalf to bring about the effect. Depending on the genie's nature, the genie might try to pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting the wish's poor wording. The perversion of the wording is usually crafted to be to the genie's benefit.</trait4>

    <trait2>Creature Sense
The elder brain is aware of the presence of creatures within 5 miles of it that have an Intelligence score of 4 or higher. It knows the distance and direction to each creature. as well as each one's intelligence score, but can’t sense anything else about it. A creature protected by a mind blank spell. a nondetection spell, or similar magic can’t be perceived in this manner. </trait2>
    <trait3>Innate Spellcasting (Psionics)
The elder brain’s innate spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 18). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no components:



At will: detect thoughts, levitate



1/day each: dominate monster, plane shift (self only)</trait3>
    <trait4>Legendary Resistance (3/Day)
If the elder brain fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.</trait4>
    <trait5>Magic Resistance
The elder brain has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</trait5>
    <trait6>Telepathic Hub
The elder brain can use its telepathy to initiate and maintain telepathic conversations with up to ten creatures at a time. The elder brain can let those creatures telepathically hear each other while connected in this way.</trait6>
    <action1>Tentacle
Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. Hit: 20 (4d8+2) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Huge or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 15) and takes 9 (1d8+5) psychic damage at the start of each of its turns until the grapple ends. The elder brain can have up to four targets grappled at a time.



Grappled:

• A grappled creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.



• The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated.



• The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by the thunderwave spell.</action1>
    <action2>Mind Blast (Recharge 5-6)
The elder brain magically emits psychic energy. Creatures of the elder brain's choice within 60 feet of it must succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence saving throw or take 32 (5d10+5) psychic damage and be stunned for 1 minute. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.



Stunned:

• A stunned creature is incapacitated, meaning it can't take actions or reactions, can't move, and can speak only falteringly.



• The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.</action2>
    <action3>Psychic Link
The elder brain targets one incapacitated creature it can perceive with its Creature Sense trait and establishes a psychic link with that creature. Until the psychic link ends, the elder brain can perceive everything the target senses. The target becomes aware that something is linked to its mind once it is no longer incapacitated, and the elder brain can terminate the link at any time (no action required). The target can use an action on its turn to attempt to break the psychic link, doing so with a successful DC 18 Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, the target takes 10 (3d6) psychic damage. The psychic link also ends if the target and the elder brain are more than 5 miles apart, with no consequences to the target. The elder brain can form psychic links with up to ten creatures at a time.</action3>
    <action4>Sense Thoughts
The elder brain targets a creature with which it has a psychic link. The elder brain gains insight into the target’s reasoning, its emotional state, and thoughts that loom large in its mind (including things the target worries about, loves, or hates). The elder brain can also make a Charisma (Deception) check with advantage to deceive the target's mind into thinking it believes one idea or feels a particular emotion. The target contests this attempt with a Wisdom (Insight) check. If the elder brain succeeds, the mind believes the deception for 1 hour or until evidence of the lie is presented to the target.</action4>
    <legendary1>Legendary Actions (3/Turn)
The elder brain can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. It can take only one legendary action at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The elder brain regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.</legendary1>
    <legendary2>Tentacle
The elder brain makes a tentacle attack.</legendary2>
    <legendary3>Break Concentration
The elder brain targets a creature within 120 feet of it with which it has a psychic link. The elder brain breaks the creature’s concentration on a spell it has cast. The creature also takes 1d4 psychic damage per level of the spell.</legendary3>
    <legendary4>Psychic Pulse
The elder brain targets a creature within 120 feet of it with which it has a psychic link. Enemies of the elder brain within 10 feet of that creature take 10 (3d6) psychic damage.</legendary4>
    <legendary5>Sever Psychic Link
The elder brain targets a creature within 120 feet of it with which it has a psychic link. The elder brain ends the link, causing the creature to have disadvantage on all ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws until the end of the creature’s next turn.</legendary5>

	Yellow — 11-20 years

	Green — 21-30 years

	Blue — 31-40 years

	Indigo — 41-50 years

	Violet — 51 years or more

	A green or older faerie dragon's CR increases to 2.</trait2>
    <trait3>Superior Invisibility
As a bonus action, the dragon can magically turn invisible until its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment the dragon wears or carries is invisible with it.



Invisible:

• An invisible creature is impossible to see without the aid of magic or a special sense. For the purpose of hiding, the creature is heavily obscured. The creature's location can be detected by any noise it makes or any tracks it leaves.



• Attack rolls against the creature have disadvantage, and the creature's attack rolls have advantage.</trait3>
    <trait4>Limited Telepathy
Using telepathy, the dragon can magically communicate with any other faerie dragon within 60 feet of it.</trait4>
    <trait5>Magic Resistance
The faerie dragon has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</trait5>
    <trait6>Innate Spellcasting
The dragon's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 13). It can innately cast a number of spells, requiring no material components. As the dragon ages and changes color, it gains additional spells as shown below.

	1-4. The target takes no action or bonus action and uses all of its movement to move in a random direction.

	5-6. The target doesn't move, and the only thing it can do on its turn is make a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.</action2>

    <trait2>Shapechanger (2/day)
The fathomer can use its action to polymorph into a Medium serpent composed of water, or back into its true form. Anything the fathomer is wearing or carrying is subsumed into the serpent form during the change, inaccessible until the fathomer returns to its true form. The fathomer reverts to its true form after 4 hours, unless it can expend another use of this trait. If the fathomer is knocked unconscious or dies, it also reverts to its true form.

	While in serpent form, the fathomer gains a swimming speed of 40 feet, the ability to breathe underwater, immunity to poison damage, as well as resistance to fire damage and bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons. It also has immunity to the following conditions: exhaustion, grappled, paralyzed, poisoned, restrained, prone, unconscious. The serpent form can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. In addition, if water can pass through a space, the serpent can do so without squeezing.</trait2>
    <trait3>Olhydra's Armor (Human Form Only)
The fathomer can cast mage armor at will, without expending material components.</trait3>
    <trait4>Spellcasting (Human Form Only)
The fathomer is a 5th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 12, +4 to hit with spell attacks). It has two 3rd-level spell slots, which it regains after finishing a short or long rest, and knows the following warlock spells:



• Cantrips (at will): chill touch, eldritch blast, mage hand



• 1st level: armor of Agathys, expeditious retreat, hex



• 2nd level: invisibility



• 3rd level: Vampiric touch</trait4>
    <action1>Constrict (Serpent Form Only)
Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (2d6+2) bludgeoning damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it is grappled (escape DC 12). Until the grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the fathomer can't constrict another target.



Grappled:

• A grappled creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.



• The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated.



• The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by the thunderwave spell.



Restrained:

• A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.



• The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.</action1>

    <trait2>Antimagic Shell
The snail has advantage on saving throws against spells, and any creature making a spell attack against the snail has disadvantage on the attack roll. If the snail succeeds on its saving throw against a spell or a spell attack misses it, an additional effect might occur, as determined by rolling a d6:



1-2: If the spell affects an area or has multiple targets, it fails and has no effect. If the spell targets only the snail, it has no effect on the snail and is reflected back at the caster, using the spell slot level, spell save DC, attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the caster.



3-4: No additional effect.



5-6: The snail’s shell converts some of the spell's energy into a burst of destructive force. Each creature within 30 feet of the snail must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 1d6 force damage per level of the spell on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</trait2>
    <trait3>Flail Tentacles
The flail snail has five flail tentacles. Whenever the snail takes 10 damage or more on a single turn, one of its tentacles dies. If even one tentacle remains, the snail regrows all dead ones within 1d4 days. If all its tentacles die, the snail retracts into its shell, gaining total cover, and it begins wailing, a sound that can be heard for 600 feet, stopping only when it dies 5d6 minutes later. Healing magic that restores limbs, such as the regenerate spell, can halt this dying process.</trait3>
    <action1>Multiattack
The flail snail makes as many flail tentacle attacks as it has flail tentacles, all against the same target.</action1>
    <action2>Flail Tentacle
Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6+3) bludgeoning damage.</action2>
    <action3>Scintillating Shell (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest)
The snail's shell emits dazzling, colored light until the end of the snail’s next turn. During this time, the shell sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet, and creatures that can see the snail have disadvantage on attack rolls against it. In addition, any creature within the bright light and able to see the snail when this power is activated must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be stunned until the light ends.



Stunned:

• A stunned creature is incapacitated, meaning it can't take actions or reactions, can't move, and can speak only falteringly.



• The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.</action3>
    <action4>Shell Defense
The flail snail withdraws into its shell, gaining a +4 bonus to AC until it emerges. It can emerge from its shell as a bonus action on its turn.</action4>

    <trait2>Berserk
Whenever the golem starts its turn with 40 hit points or fewer, roll a d6. On a 6, the golem goes berserk. On each of its turns while berserk, the golem attacks the nearest creature it can see. If no creature is near enough to move to and attack, the golem attacks an object, with preference for an object smaller than itself. Once the golem goes berserk, it continues to do so until it is destroyed or regains all its hit points.

	The golem's creator, if within 60 feet of the berserk golem, can try to calm it by speaking firmly and persuasively. The golem must be able to hear its creator, who must take an action to make a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check. If the check succeeds, the golem ceases being berserk. If it takes damage while still at 40 hit points or fewer, the golem might go berserk again.</trait2>

    <trait2>Amphibious
The froghemoth can breathe air and water.</trait2>
    <trait3>Shock Suscptibility
If the froghemoth takes lightning damage, it suffers several effects until the end of its next turn: its speed is halved, it takes a -2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, it can’t use reactions or Multiattack, and on its turn, it can use either an action or a bonus action, not both.</trait3>
    <action1>Multiattack
The froghemoth makes two attacks with its tentacles. It can also use its tongue or bite.</action1>
    <action2>Tentacle
Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 19 (3d8+6) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 16) if it is a Huge or smaller creature. Until the grapple ends, the froghemoth can’t use this tentacle on another target. The froghemoth has four tentacles.



Grappled:

• A grappled creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.



• The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated.



• The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by the thunderwave spell.</action2>
    <action3>Bite
Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft, one target. Hit: 22 (3d10+6) piercing damage, and the target is swallowed if it is a Medium or smaller creature. A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the froghemoth, and takes 10 (3d6) acid damage at the start of each of the froghemoth’s turns.

	The froghemoth’s gullet can hold up to two creatures at a time. If the Froghemoth takes 20 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the Froghemoth must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, each of which falls prone in a space within 10 feet of the froghemoth. If the froghemoth dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 10 feet of movement, exiting prone.



Blinded:

• A blinded creature can't see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.



Restrained:

• A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.



• The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.</action3>
    <action4>Tongue
The Froghemoth targets one Medium or smaller creature that it can see within 20 feet of it. The target must make a DC 18 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target is pulled into an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the froghemoth, and the froghemoth can make a bite attack against it as a bonus action.</action4>

Any creature can use its action to make a DC 17 Strength check to free itself or another creature in the net, ending the effect on a success. Dealing 15 slashing damage to the net (AC 12) destroys the net and frees the target.

Prone:

• A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.

The gas spore explodes when it drops to 0 hit points. Each creature within 20 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 10 (3d6) poison damage and become infected with a disease on a failed save. Creatures immune to the poisoned condition are immune to this disease.

	Spores invade an infected creature's system, killing the creature in a number of hours equal to 1d12+the creature's Constitution score, unless the disease is removed.

A creature that fails the save is stunned until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the gauth in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.



Stunned:

• A stunned creature is incapacitated, meaning it can't take actions or reactions, can't move, and can speak only falteringly.



• The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.</trait2>
    <trait3>Death Throes
When the gauth dies, the magical energy within it explodes, and each creature within 10 feet of it must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 13 (3d8) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</trait3>
    <action1>Bite
Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (2d8) piercing damage.</action1>
    <action2>Eye Rays
The gauth shoots three of the following magical eye rays at random (reroll duplicates), choosing one to three targets it can see within 120 feet of it:



1. Devour Magic Ray: The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or have one of its magic items lose all magical properties until the start of the gauth's next turn. If the object is a charged item, it also loses 1d4 charges. Determine the affected item randomly, ignoring single-use items such as potions and scrolls.



2. Enervation Ray: The targeted creature must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.



3. Pushing Ray: The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 15 feet directly away from the gauth and have its speed halved until the start of the gauth's next turn.



4. Fire Ray: The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 22 (4d10) fire damage.



5. Paralyzing Ray: The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.



6. Sleep Ray: The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or fall asleep and remain unconscious for 1 minute. The target awakens if it takes damage or another creature takes an action to wake it. This ray has no effect on constructs and undead.



Paralyzed:

• A paralyzed creature is incapacitated, meaning it can't take actions or reactions, and can't move or speak.



• The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.



• Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.



Unconscious:

• An unconscious creature is incapacitated, meaning it can't take actions or reactions, can't move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings.



• The creature drops whatever it's holding and falls prone.



• The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.



• Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.</action2>

7. Dazing Ray: The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed until the start of the gazer's next turn. While the target is charmed in this way, its speed is halved, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls.



2. Fear Ray: The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the start of the gazer's next turn.



3. Frost Ray: The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) cold damage.



4. Telekinetic Ray: If the target is a creature that is Medium or smaller, it must succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw or be moved up to 30 feet directly away from the gazer.

	If the target is an object weighing 10 pounds or less that isn't being worn or carried, the gazer moves it up to 30 feet in any direction. The gazer can also exert fine control on objects with this ray, such as manipulating a simple tool or opening a container.



Charmed:

• A charmed creature can't attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects.



• The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature.



Frightened:

• A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight.



• The creature can't willingly move closer to the source of its fear.</action2>

    <trait2>Ooze Cube
The cube takes up its entire space. Other creatures can enter the space, but a creature that does so is subjected to the cube's Engulf and has disadvantage on the saving throw.

	Creatures inside the cube can be seen but have total cover.

	A creature within 5 feet of the cube can take an action to pull a creature or object out of the cube. Doing so requires a successful DC 12 Strength check, and the creature making the attempt takes 10 (3d6) acid damage.

	The cube can hold only one Large creature or up to four Medium or smaller creatures inside it at a time.</trait2>
    <trait3>Transparent
Even when the cube is in plain sight, it takes a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to spot a cube that has neither moved nor attacked. A creature that tries to enter the cube's space while unaware of the cube is surprised by the cube.</trait3>
    <action1>Pseudopod
Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 10 (3d6) acid damage.</action1>
    <action2>Engulf
The cube moves up to its speed. While doing so, it can enter Large or smaller creatures' spaces. Whenever the cube enters a creature's space, the creature must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw.

	On a successful save, the creature can choose to be pushed 5 feet back or to the side of the cube. A creature that chooses not to be pushed suffers the consequences of a failed saving throw.

	On a failed save, the cube enters the creature's space, and the creature takes 10 (3d6) acid damage and is engulfed. The engulfed creature can't breathe, is restrained, and takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the cube's turns. When the cube moves, the engulfed creature moves with it.

	An engulfed creature can try to escape by taking an action to make a DC 12 Strength check. On a success, the creature escapes and enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of the cube.



Restrained:

• A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.



• The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.</action2>

    <action3>Horrifying Visage
Each non-undead creature within 60 ft. of the ghost that can see it must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. If the save fails by 5 or more, the target also ages 1d4 _ 10 years. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the frightened condition on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to this ghost's Horrifying Visage for the next 24 hours. The aging effect can be reversed with a greater restoration spell, but only within 24 hours of it occurring.



Frightened:

• A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight.



• The creature can't willingly move closer to the source of its fear.</action3>
    <action4>Possession (Recharge 6)
One humanoid that the ghost can see within 5 ft. of it must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or be possessed by the ghost; the ghost then disappears, and the target is incapacitated and loses control of its body. The ghost now controls the body but doesn't deprive the target of awareness. The ghost can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, except ones that turn undead, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being charmed and frightened. It otherwise uses the possessed target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.

	The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the ghost ends it as a bonus action, or the ghost is turned or forced out by an effect like the dispel evil and good spell. When the possession ends, the ghost reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 ft. of the body. The target is immune to this ghost's Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends.

The toad can have only one target swallowed at a time.

	If the toad dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 5 feet of movement, exiting prone.



Blinded:

• A blinded creature can't see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.



Prone:

• A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.

    <action1>Multiattack
The lizard makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its tail. One attack can be replaced by Swallow.</action1>
    <action2>Bite
Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d10 + 5) piercing damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the lizard can't bite another target.



Grappled:

• A grappled creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.



• The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated.



• The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by the thunderwave spell.



Restrained:

• A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.



• The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.</action2>
    <action3>Tail
Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target not grappled by the lizard. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC l 5 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.



Prone:

• A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.



• The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.



• An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.</action3>
    <action4>Swallow
Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one Medium or smaller creature the lizard is grappling. Hit: 16 (2d10 + 5) piercing damage, the target is swallowed, and the grapp le ends. The swallowed target is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the lizard, and it takes 10 (3d6) acid damage at the start of each of the lizard's turns. The lizard can have only one target swallowed at a time.

	If the lizard dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 10 feet of movement, exiting prone.



Blinded:

• A blinded creature can't see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.



Prone:

• A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.



• The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.



• An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.



Restrained:

• A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.



• The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.</action4>

The ground in a 10-foot radius around the mouther is doughlike difficult terrain. Each creature that starts its turn in that area must succeed on a DC 10 Strength saving throw or have its speed reduced to 0 until the start of its next turn.</trait2>
    <trait3>Gibbering
The mouther babbles incoherently while it can see any creature and isn't incapacitated. Each creature that starts its turn within 20 feet of the mouther and can hear the gibbering must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature can't take reactions until the start of its next turn and rolls a d8 to determine what it does during its turn. On a 1 to 4, the creature does nothing. On a 5 or 6, the creature takes no action or bonus action and uses all its movement to move in a randomly determined direction. On a 7 or 8, the creature makes a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach or does nothing if it can't make such an attack.</trait3>

    <trait2>Innate Spellcasting
The glabrezu's spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 16). The glabrezu can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

	At will: darkness, detect magic, dispel magic

	1/day each: confusion, fly, power word stun</trait2>
    <trait3>Magic Resistance
The glabrezu has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</trait3>
    <action1>Multiattack
The glabrezu makes four attacks: two with its pincers and two with its fists. Alternatively, it makes two attacks with its pincers and casts one spell.</action1>
    <action2>Pincer
Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d10+5) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 15). The glabrezu has two pincers, each of which can grapple only one target.



Grappled:

• A grappled creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.



• The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated.



• The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by the thunderwave spell.</action2>
    <action3>Fist
Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (2d4+2) bludgeoning damage.</action3>
    <action4>Variant: Summon Demon (1/Day)
The demon chooses what to summon and attempts a magical summoning.

	A glabrezu has a 30 percent chance of summoning 1d3 vrocks, 1d2 hezrous, or one glabrezu.

	A summoned demon appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of its summoner, acts as an ally of its summoner, and can't summon other demons. It remains for 1 minute, until it or its summoner dies, or until its summoner dismisses it as an action.</action4>

Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 9 (2d4+4) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.



Prone:

• A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.



• The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.



• An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.</action3>

    <trait2>Trampling Charge
If the gorgon moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a gore attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the gorgon can make one attack with its hooves against it as a bonus action.



Prone:

• A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.



• The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.



• An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.</trait2>
    <action1>Gore
Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (2d12+5) piercing damage.</action1>
    <action2>Hooves
Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d10+5) bludgeoning damage.</action2>
    <action3>Petrifying Breath (Recharge 5-6)
The gorgon exhales petrifying gas in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target begins to turn to stone and is restrained. The restrained target must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends on the target. On a failure, the target is petrified until freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.



Petrified:

• A petrified creature is transformed, along with any nonmagical object it is wearing or carrying, into a solid inanimate substance (usually stone). Its weight increases by a factor of ten, and it ceases aging.



• The creature is incapacitated (meaning it can't take actions or reactions), can't move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.



• The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.



• The creature has resistance to all damage.



• The creature is immune to poison and disease, although a poison or disease already in its system is suspended, not neutralized.



Restrained:

• A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.



• The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.</action3>

The slaad can use its action to polymorph into a Small or Medium humanoid, or back into its true form. Its statistics, other than its size, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.</trait2>
    <trait3>Innate Spellcasting
The slaad's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14). The slaad can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:



	At will: detect magic, detect thoughts, invisibility (self only), mage hand, major image

	2/day each: fear, fly, fireball, tongues

	1/day: plane shift (self only)</trait3>
    <trait4>Magic Resistance
The slaad has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects</trait4>
    <trait5>Magic Weapons
The slaad's weapon attacks are magical.</trait5>
    <trait6>Regeneration
The slaad regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point.</trait6>
    <trait7>Variant: Control Gem
Implanted in the slaad's brain is a magic control gem. The slaad must obey whoever possesses the gem and is immune to being charmed while so controlled.

	Certain spells can be used to acquire the gem. If the slaad fails its saving throw against imprisonment, the spell can transfer the gem to the spellcaster's open hand, instead of imprisoning the slaad. A wish spell, if cast in the slaad's presence, can be worded to acquire the gem.

	A greater restoration spell cast on the slaad destroys the gem without harming the slaad.

	Someone who is proficient in Wisdom (Medicine) can remove the gem from an incapacitated slaad. Each try requires 1 minute of uninterrupted work and a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Medicine) check. Each failed attempt deals 22 (4d10) psychic damage to the slaad.</trait7>

The hag can breathe air and water.</trait2>
    <trait3>Innate Spellcasting
The hag's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 12). She can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:



	At will: dancing lights, minor illusion, vicious mockery</trait3>
    <trait4>Mimicry
The hag can mimic animal sounds and humanoid voices. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Insight) check.</trait4>
    <trait5>Hag Coven
When hags must work together, they form covens, in spite of their selfish natures. A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of whom are equals within the group. However, each of the hags continues to desire more personal power.

	A coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two hags can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever come together, as might happen if two covens come into conflict, the result is usually chaos.</trait5>
    <trait6>Shared Spellcasting (Coven Only)
While all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard's spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves:



• 1st level (4 slots): identify, ray of sickness



• 2nd level (3 slots): hold person, locate object



• 3rd level (3 slots): bestow curse, counterspell, lightning bolt



• 4th level (3 slots): phantasmal killer, polymorph



• 5th level (2 slots): contact other plane, scrying



• 6th level (1 slot): eyebite



	For casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The spell save DC is 12+the hag's Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack bonus is 4+the hag's Intelligence modifier.</trait6>
    <trait7>Hag Eye (Coven Only)
A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.

	A hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.</trait7>
    <trait8>Variant: Death Coven
For a death coven, replace the spell list of the hags' Shared Spellcasting trait with the folllowing spells:



1st level (4 slots): false life, inflict wounds



2nd level (3 slots): gentle repose, ray of enfeeblement



3rd level (3 slots): animate dead, revivify, speak with dead



4th level (3 slots): blight, death ward



5th level (2 slots): contagion, raise dead



6th level (1 slot): circle of death</trait8>
    <trait9>Variant: Nature Coven
For a nature coven, replace the spell list of the hags' Shared Spellcasting trait with the folllowing spells:



1st level (4 slots): entangle, speak with animals



2nd level (3 slots): flaming sphere, moonbeam, spike growth



3rd level (3 slots): call lightning, plant growth



4th level (3 slots): dominate beast, grasping vine



5th level (2 slots): insect plague, tree stride



6th level (1 slot): wall of thorns</trait9>
    <trait10>Variant: Prophecy Coven
For a prophecy coven, replace the spell list of the hags' Shared Spellcasting trait with the folllowing spells:



1st level (4 slots): bane, bless



2nd level (3 slots): augury, detect thoughts



3rd level (3 slots): calirvoyance, dispel magic, nondetection



4th level (3 slots): arcane eye, locate creature



5th level (2 slots): geas, legend lore



6th level (1 slot): true seeing</trait10>
    <action1>Claws
Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8+4) slashing damage.</action1>
    <action2>Illusory Appearance
The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that makes her look like another creature of her general size and humanoid shape. The illusion ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies.

	The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have smooth skin, but someone touching her would feel her rough flesh. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the hag is disguised.</action2>
    <action3>Invisible Passage
The hag magically turns invisible until she attacks or casts a spell, or until her concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). While invisible, she leaves no physical evidence of her passage, so she can be tracked only by magic. Any equipment she wears or carries is invisible with her.



Invisible:

• An invisible creature is impossible to see without the aid of magic or a special sense. For the purpose of hiding, the creature is heavily obscured. The creature's location can be detected by any noise it makes or any tracks it leaves.



• Attack rolls against the creature have disadvantage, and the creature's attack rolls have advantage.</action3>

    <trait1>Source
Monster Manual, p. 277</trait1>
    <trait2>Shapechanger
The slaad can use its action to polymorph into a Small or Medium humanoid, or back into its true form. Its statistics, other than its size, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.</trait2>
    <trait3>Innate Spellcasting
The slaad's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 12). The slaad can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:



	At will: detect magic, detect thoughts, mage hand

	2/day each: fear, invisibility (self only)

	1/day: fireball</trait3>
    <trait4>Magic Resistance
The slaad has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects</trait4>
    <trait5>Regeneration
The slaad regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point.</trait5>
    <trait6>Variant: Control Gem
Implanted in the slaad's brain is a magic control gem. The slaad must obey whoever possesses the gem and is immune to being charmed while so controlled.

	Certain spells can be used to acquire the gem. If the slaad fails its saving throw against imprisonment, the spell can transfer the gem to the spellcaster's open hand, instead of imprisoning the slaad. A wish spell, if cast in the slaad's presence, can be worded to acquire the gem.

	A greater restoration spell cast on the slaad destroys the gem without harming the slaad.

	Someone who is proficient in Wisdom (Medicine) can remove the gem from an incapacitated slaad. Each try requires 1 minute of uninterrupted work and a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Medicine) check. Each failed attempt deals 22 (4d10) psychic damage to the slaad.</trait6>
    <action1>Multiattack
The slaad makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws or staff. Alternatively, it uses its Hurl Flame twice.</action1>
    <action2>Bite (Slaad Form Only)
Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6+4) piercing damage.</action2>
    <action3>Claw (Slaad Form Only)

    <action5>Hurl Flame
Ranged Spell Attack: +4 to hit, range 60 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (3d6) fire damage. The fire ignites flammable objects that aren't being worn or carried.</action5>

    <action1>Multiattack
The grell makes two attacks: one with its tentacles and one with its beak.</action1>
    <action2>Tentacles
Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. Hit: 7 (1d10+2) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. The poisoned target is paralyzed, and it can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

	The target is also grappled (escape DC 15). If the target is Medium or smaller, it is also restrained until this grapple ends. While grappling the target, the grell has advantage on attack rolls against it and can't use this attack against other targets. When the grell moves, any Medium or smaller target it is grappling moves with it.



Grappled:

• A grappled creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.



• The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated.



• The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by the thunderwave spell.



Paralyzed:

• A paralyzed creature is incapacitated, meaning it can't take actions or reactions, and can't move or speak.



• The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.



• Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.



Poisoned:

• A poisoned creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.



Restrained:

• A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.



• The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.</action2>

    <action4>Luring Song
The harpy sings a magical melody. Every humanoid and giant within 300 ft. of the harpy that can hear the song must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed until the song ends. The harpy must take a bonus action on its subsequent turns to continue singing. It can stop singing at any time. The song ends if the harpy is incapacitated.

	While charmed by the harpy, a target is incapacitated and ignores the songs of other harpies. If the charmed target is more than 5 ft. away from the harpy, the target must move on its turn toward the harpy by the most direct route. It doesn't avoid opportunity attacks, but before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, and whenever it takes damage from a source other than the harpy, a target can repeat the saving throw. A creature can also repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If a creature's saving throw is successful, the effect ends on it.

	A target that successfully saves is immune to this harpy's song for the next 24 hours.



Charmed:

• A charmed creature can't attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects.



• The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature.</action4>

    <action5>Wall of Ice
The devil magically forms an opaque wall of ice on a solid surface it can see within 60 feet of it. The wall is 1 foot thick and up to 30 feet long and 10 feet high, or it's a hemispherical dome up to 20 feet in diameter.

	When the wall appears, each creature in its space is pushed out of it by the shortest route. The creature chooses which side of the wall to end up on, unless the creature is incapacitated. The creature then makes a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 35 (10d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

	The wall lasts for 1 minute or until the devil is incapacitated or dies. The wall can be damaged and breached; each 10-foot section has AC 5, 30 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. If a section is destroyed, it leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the space the wall occupied. Whenever a creature finishes moving through the frigid air on a turn, willingly or otherwise, the creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 17 (5d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The frigid air dissipates when the rest of the wall vanishes.</action5>

    <trait2>Empowered Attacks
Imix's slam attacks are treated as magical for the purpose of bypassing resistance and immunity to nonmagical weapons.</trait2>
    <trait3>Fire Aura
At the start of each of Imix's turns, each creature within 10 feet of him takes 17 (5d6) fire damage, and flammable objects in the aura that aren't being worn or carried ignite. A creature also takes 17 (5d6) fire damage if it touches Imix or hits him with a melee attack while within 10 feet of him, and a creature takes that damage the first time on a turn that Imix moves into its space. Nonmagical weapons that hit Imix are destroyed by fire immediately after dealing damage to him</trait3>
    <trait4>Fire Form
Imix can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. He can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch without squeezing if fire could pass through that space.</trait4>
    <trait5>Illumination
Imix sheds bright light in a 60-foot radius and dim light for an additional 60 feet.</trait5>
    <trait6>Legendary Resistance (3/Day)

• At will: fireball, wall of fire



• 3/day each: fire storm, haste, teleport</trait7>
    <trait8>Magic Resistance

    <legendary1>Legendary Actions (3/Turn)
Imix can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time, and only at the end of another creature's turn. Imix regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.</legendary1>
    <legendary2>Heat Wave
Imix creates a blast of heat within 300 feet of himself. Each creature in the area in physical contact with metal objects (for example, carrying metal weapons or wearing metal armor) takes 9 (2d8) fire damage. Each creature in the area that isn't resistant or immune to fire damage must make a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion.Exhaustion:	Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect's description.Level — Effect:1 —Disadvantage on ability checks2 —Speed halved3 —Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws4 —Hit point maximum halved5 —Speed reduced to 0	6 —DeathIf an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect's description.	A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.	An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect's description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature's exhaustion level is reduced below 1.	Finishing a long rest reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink.</legendary2>
    <legendary3>Teleport (Costs 2 Actions)
Imix magically teleports up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space he can see. Anything Imix is wearing or carrying isn't teleported with him.</legendary3>

On a failed save, the target takes 70 (20d6) fire damage and catches fire. A target on fire takes 10 (3d6) fire damage when it starts its turn, and remains on fire until it or another creature takes an action to douse the flames. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and doesn't catch fire.</legendary4>

While the imp is within 10 feet of its master, the master shares the quasit's Magic Resistance trait. At any time and for any reason, the imp can end its service as a familiar, ending the telepathic bond.</trait5>

The imp magically turns invisible until it attacks, or until its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment the imp wears or carries is invisible with it.



Invisible:

    <trait2>Detect Sentience
The intellect devourer can sense the presence and location of any creature within 300 feet of it that has an Intelligence of 3 or higher, regardless of interposing barriers, unless the creature is protected by a mind blank spell.</trait2>
    <action1>Multiattack

Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (2d4+2) slashing damage.</action2>
    <action3>Devour Intellect
The intellect devourer targets one creature it can see within 10 feet of it that has a brain. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Intelligence saving throw against this magic or take 11 (2d10) psychic damage. Also on a failure, roll 3d6: If the total equals or exceeds the target's Intelligence score, that score is reduced to 0. The target is stunned until it regains at least one point of Intelligence.



Stunned:

• A stunned creature is incapacitated, meaning it can't take actions or reactions, can't move, and can speak only falteringly.



• The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.</action3>
    <action4>Body Thief
The intellect devourer initiates an Intelligence contest with an incapacitated humanoid within 5 feet of it that isn't protected by protection from evil and good. If it wins the contest, the intellect devourer magically consumes the target's brain, teleports into the target's skull, and takes control of the target's body. While inside a creature, the intellect devourer has total cover against attacks and other effects originating outside its host. The intellect devourer retains its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as its understanding of Deep Speech, its telepathy, and its traits. It otherwise adopts the target's statistics. It knows everything the creature knew, including spells and languages.

	If the host body dies, the intellect devourer must leave it. A protection from evil and good spell cast on the body drives the intellect devourer out. The intellect devourer is also forced out if the target regains its devoured brain by means of a wish. By spending 5 feet of its movement, the intellect devourer can voluntarily leave the body, teleporting to the nearest unoccupied space within 5 feet of it. The body then dies, unless its brain is restored within 1 round.</action4>

A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to Iymrith's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.



Frightened:

    <action3>Sleep Gaze
The jackalwere gazes at one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target succumbs to a magical slumber, falling unconscious for 10 minutes or until someone uses an action to shake the target awake. A creature that successfully saves against the effect is immune to this jackalwere's gaze for the next 24 hours. Undead and creatures immune to being charmed aren't affected by it.



Unconscious:

• An unconscious creature is incapacitated, meaning it can't take actions or reactions, can't move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings.



• The creature drops whatever it's holding and falls prone.



• The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.



• Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.</action3>

    <trait3>Innate Spellcasting
Juiblex's spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 18, +10 to hit with spell attacks). Juiblex can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:



	At will: acid splash (17th level), detect magic

    <action3>Eject Slime (Recharge 5-6)
Juiblex spews out a corrosive slime, targeting one creature that it can see within 60 feet of it. The target must make a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 55 (10d10) acid damage. Unless the target avoids taking any of this damage, any metal armor worn by the target takes a permanent -1 penalty to the AC it offers, and any metal weapon it is carrying or wearing takes a permanent -1 penalty to damage rolls. The penalty worsens each time a target is subjected to this effect. If the penalty on an object drops to -5, the object is destroyed.</action3>
    <legendary1>Legendary Actions (3/Turn)
Juiblex can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Juiblex regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.</legendary1>

Kalka-Kylla makes two claw attacks.</action1>
    <action2>Claw
Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage, and if the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 13). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained. Kalka-Kylla has two claws, each of which can grapple only one target.



Grappled:

• A grappled creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.



• The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated.



• The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by the thunderwave spell.



Restrained:

• A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.



• The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.</action2>

If the kamadan moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a claw attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is knocked prone, the kamadan can make two attacks — one with its bite and one with its snakes — against it as a bonus action.



Prone:

• A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.

Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</action4>
    <action5>Sleep Breath (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest)
The kamadan exhales sleep gas in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious for 10 minutes. This effect ends for a creature if it takes damage or someone uses an action to wake it.



Unconscious:

• An unconscious creature is incapacitated, meaning it can't take actions or reactions, can't move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings.



• The creature drops whatever it's holding and falls prone.



• The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.



• Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.</action5>

The kelpie can breathe air and water.</trait2>
    <trait3>Seaweed Shape
The kelpie can use its action to reshape its body into the form of a humanoid or beast that is Small, Medium, or Large. Its statistics are otherwise unchanged. The disguise is convincing, unless the kelpie is in bright light or the viewer is within 30 feet of it, in which case the seams between the seaweed strands are visible. The kelpie returns to its true form if takes a bonus action to do so or if it dies.</trait3>
    <trait4>False Appearance
While the kelpie remains motionless in its true form, it is indistinguishable from normal seaweed.</trait4>
    <action1>Multiattack
The kelpie makes two slam attacks.</action1>
    <action2>Slam
Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d8 + 2) piercing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 12).



Grappled:

• A grappled creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.



• The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated.



• The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by the thunderwave spell.</action2>
    <action3>Drowning Hypnosis
The kelpie chooses one humanoid it can see within 150 feet of it. If the target can see the kelpie, the target must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed while the kelpie maintains concentration, up to 10 minutes (as if concentrating on a spell).

	The charmed target is incapacitated, and instead of holding its breath underwater, it tries to breathe normally and immediately runs out of breath, unless it can breathe water.

	If the charmed target is more than 5 feet away from the kelpie, the target must move on its turn toward the kelpie by the most direct route, trying to get within 5 feet. It doesn't avoid opportunity attacks.

	Before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, and whenever it takes damage from a source other than the kelpie or drowning, the target can repeat the saving throw. A charmed target can also repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If the saving throw is successful, the effect ends on it.

	A target that successfully saves is immune to this kelpie's hypnosis for the next 24 hours.



Charmed:

• A charmed creature can't attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects.



• The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature.



Incapacitated:

• An incapacitated creature can't take actions or reactions.</action3>

    <action3>Weapon Invention
The kobold uses one of the following options (roll a d8 or choose one); the kobold can use each one no more than once per day:



1. Acid. The kobold hurls a flask of acid. Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 5/20 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (2d6) acid damage.



2. Alchemist’s fire. The kobold throws a flask of alchemist's fire. Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 5/20 ft., one target. Hit: 2 (1d4) fire damage at the start of each of the target’s turns. A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames.



3. Basket of Centipedes. The kobold throws a small basket into a S-foot-square space within 20 feet of it. A swarm of insects (centipedes) with 11 hit points emerges from the basket and rolls initiative. At the end of each of the swarm’s turns, there's a 50 percent chance that the swarm disperses.



4. Green Slime Pot. The kobold throws a clay pot full of green slime at the target, and it breaks open on impact. Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 5/20 ft., one target. Hit: The target is covered in a patch of green slime (see chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide). Miss: A patch of green slime covers a randomly determined S-foot-square section of wall or floor within 5 feet of the target.



5. Rot Grub Pot. The kobold throws a clay pot into a 5-foot-square space within 20 feet of it, and it breaks open on impact. A swarm of rot grubs (see appendix A) emerges from the shattered pot and remains a hazard in that square.



6. Scorpion on a Stick. The kobold makes a melee attack with a scorpion tied to the end of a 5-foot-long pole. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 1 piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 9 Constitution saving throw, taking 4 (1d8) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.



7. Skunk in a Cage. The kobold releases a skunk into an unoccupied space within 5 feet of it. The skunk has a walking speed of 20 feet, AC 10, 1 hit point, and no effective attacks. It rolls initiative and, on its turn, uses its action to spray musk at a random creature within 5 feet of it. The target must make a DC 9 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target retches and can’t take actions for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that doesn’t need to breathe or is immune to poison automatically succeeds on the saving throw. Once the skunk has sprayed its musk, it can’t do so again until it finishes a short or long rest.



8. Wasp Nest in a Bag. The kobold throws a small bag into a 5-foot-square space within 20 feet of it. A swarm of insects (wasps) with 11 hit points emerges from the bag and rolls initiative. At the end of each of the swarm's turns, there’s a 50 percent chance that the swarm disperses.</action3>

    <trait2>Amphibious
The kraken can breathe air and water.</trait2>
    <trait3>Freedom of Movement
The kraken ignores difficult terrain, and magical effects can't reduce its speed or cause it to be restrained. It can spend 5 feet of movement to escape from nonmagical restraints or being grappled.</trait3>
    <trait4>Siege Monster
The kraken deals double damage to objects and structures.</trait4>
    <action1>Multiattack
The kraken makes three tentacle attacks, each of which it can replace with one use of Fling.</action1>
    <action2>Bite
Melee Weapon Attack: +17 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 23 (3d8+10) piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature grappled by the kraken, that creature is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the kraken, and it takes 42 (12d6) acid damage at the start of each of the kraken's turns. If the kraken takes 50 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the kraken must succeed on a DC 25 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the kraken. If the kraken dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone.



Blinded:

• A blinded creature can't see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.



Prone:

• A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.



• The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.



• An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.



Restrained:

• A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.



• The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.</action2>
    <action3>Tentacle
Melee Weapon Attack: +17 to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. Hit: 20 (3d6+10) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 18). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained. The kraken has ten tentacles, each of which can grapple one target.



Grappled:

• A grappled creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.



• The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated.



• The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by the thunderwave spell.



Restrained:

• A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.



• The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.</action3>
    <action4>Fling
One Large or smaller object held or creature grappled by the kraken is thrown up to 60 feet in a random direction and knocked prone. If a thrown target strikes a solid surface, the target takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked prone.



Prone:

• A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.



• The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.



• An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.</action4>
    <action5>Lightning Storm
The kraken magically creates three bolts of lightning, each of which can strike a target the kraken can see within 120 feet of it. A target must make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</action5>
    <legendary1>Legendary Actions (3/Turn)
The kraken can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time, and only at the end of another creature's turn. The kraken regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.</legendary1>
    <legendary2>Tentacle Attack or Fling
The kraken makes one tentacle attack or uses its Fling.</legendary2>
    <legendary3>Lightning Storm (Costs 2 Actions)
The kraken uses Lightning Storm.</legendary3>
    <legendary4>Ink Cloud (Costs 3 Actions)
While underwater, the kraken expels an ink cloud in a 60-foot radius. The cloud spreads around corners, and that area is heavily obscured to creatures other than the kraken. Each creature other than the kraken that ends its turn there must succeed on a DC 23 Constitution saving throw, taking 16 (3d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A strong current disperses the cloud, which otherwise disappears at the end of the kraken's next turn.</legendary4>

Once a target succeeds on a saving throw against this effect, it is immune to the Evil Eye power of all Vistani for 24 hours.</action3>

    <trait2>Empowered Attacks
Maegera's slam attacks are treated as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to damage from nonmagical attacks.</trait2>
    <trait3>Fire Aura
At the start of each of Maegera's turns, each creature within 30 feet of it takes 35 (10d6) fire damage, and flammable objects in the aura that aren't being worn or carried ignite. A creature also takes 35 (10d6) fire damage from touching Maegera or from hitting it with a melee attack while within 10 feet of it, and a creature takes that damage the first time on a turn that Maegera moves into its space. Nonmagical weapons that hit Maegera are destroyed by fire immediately after dealing damage to it.</trait3>
    <trait4>Fire Form
Maegera can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. It can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch without squeezing if fire could pass through that space.</trait4>
    <trait5>Illumination
Maegera sheds bright light in a 120-foot radius and dim light for an additional 120 feet.</trait5>
    <trait6>Innate Spellcasting
Maegera can innately cast fireball (spell save DC 19) at will, requiring no material components. Maegera's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma.</trait6>

    <action2>Slam
Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (3d6+5) bludgeoning damage plus 35 (10d6) fire damage.</action2>
    <legendary1>Legendary Actions (3/Turn)
Maegera can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. It can take only one legendary action at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Maegera regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.</legendary1>
    <legendary2>Quench Magic
Maegera targets one creature that it can see within 60 feet of it. Any resistance or immunity to fire damage that the target gains from a spell or a magic item is suppressed. This effect lasts until the end of Maegera's next turn.</legendary2>
    <legendary3>Smoke Cloud (Costs 2 Actions)
Maegera exhales a billowing cloud of hot smoke and embers that fills a 60-foot cube. Each creature in that area takes 11 (2d10) fire damage. The cloud lasts until the end of Maegera's next turn. Creatures completely within the cloud are blinded and can't be seen.</legendary3>
    <legendary4>Create Fire Elemental (Costs 3 Actions)
Maegera's hit points are reduced by 50 as part of it separates and becomes a fire elemental with 102 hit points. The fire elemental appears in an unoccupied space within 15 feet of Maegera and acts on Maegera's initiative count. Maegera can't use this action if it has 50 hit points or fewer. The fire elemental obeys Maegera's commands and fights until destroyed.</legendary4>

The kraken can breathe air and water.</trait2>
    <trait3>Siege Monster
The kraken deals double damage to objects and structures.</trait3>
    <action1>Multiattack
The kraken makes three tentacle attacks. One of them can be replaced with a bite attack, and any of them can be replaced with Fling.</action1>
    <action2>Bite
Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d8 + 7) piercing damage.</action2>
    <action3>Tentacle
Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d6 + 7) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 16). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained. The kraken has ten tentacles, each of which can grapple one target.



Grappled:

• A grappled creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.



• The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated.



• The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by the thunderwave spell.



Restrained:

• A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.



• The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.</action3>
    <action4>Fling
One Medium or smaller object held or creature grappled by the kraken's tentacles is thrown up to 60 feet in a random direction and knocked prone. If a thrown target strikes a solid surface, the target takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked prone.



Prone:

• A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.



• The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.



• An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.</action4>
    <action5>Lightning Storm
The kraken creates three bolts of lightning, each of which can strike a target the kraken can see within 150 feet ofit. A target must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 16 (3dl0) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</action5>

    <trait2>Attractive Pollen (1/Day)
When the mantrap detects any creatures nearby, it can use its reaction to release pollen out to a radius of 30 feet. Any beast or humanoid within the area must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or be forced to use all its movement on its turns to get as close to the mantrap as possible. An affected target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</trait2>
    <trait3>False Appearance
While the mantrap remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from an ordinary tropical plant.</trait3>
    <action1>Engulf
Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one Medium or smaller creature. Hit: The target is trapped inside the mantrap's leafy jaws. While trapped in this way, the target is blinded and restrained, has total cover from attacks and other effects outside the mantrap, and takes 14 (4d6) acid damage at the start of each of the target's turns. If the mantrap dies, the creature inside it is no longer restrained by it. A mantrap can engulf only one creature at a time.



Blinded:

• A blinded creature can't see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.



Restrained:

• A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.



• The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.</action1>

    <trait3>Elemental Demise
If the marid dies, its body disintegrates into a burst of water and foam, leaving behind only equipment the dao was wearing or carrying.</trait3>
    <trait4>Innate Spellcasting
The marid's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 16, +8 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:



	At will: create or destroy water, detect evil and good, detect magic, fog cloud, purify food and drink

	3/day each: tongues, water breathing, water walk

	1/day each: conjure elemental (water elemental only), control water, gaseous form, invisibility, plane shift</trait4>
    <trait5>Variant: Genie Powers
Genies have a variety of magical capabilities, including spells. A few have even greater powers that allow them to alter their appearance or the nature of reality.



	Disguises.

	Some genies can veil themselves in illusion to pass as other similarly shaped creatures. Such genies can innately cast the disguise self spell at will, often with a longer duration than is normal for that spell. Mightier genies can cast the true polymorph spell one to three times per day, possibly with a longer duration than normal. Such genies can change only their own shape, but a rare few can use the spell on other creatures and objects as well.

	Wishes.

	The genie power to grant wishes is legendary among mortals. Only the most potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A particular genie that has this power can grant one to three wishes to a creature that isn't a genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can't grant wishes again for some amount of time (usually 1 year). and cosmic law dictates that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that creature's existence.

	To be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the wish spell on the creature's behalf to bring about the effect. Depending on the genie's nature, the genie might try to pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting the wish's poor wording. The perversion of the wording is usually crafted to be to the genie's benefit.</trait5>
    <action1>Multiattack

Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d6+6) piercing damage, or 15 (2d8+6) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack.</action2>
    <action3>Water Jet
The marid magically shoots water in a 60-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a target takes 21 (6d6) bludgeoning damage and, if it is Huge or smaller, is pushed up to 20 feet away from the marid and knocked prone. On a success, a target takes half the bludgeoning damage, but is neither pushed nor knocked prone.



Prone:

• A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.



• The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.



• An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.</action3>

    <trait2>Magic Resistance
The marilith has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</trait2>
    <trait3>Magic Weapons
The marilith's weapon attacks are magical.</trait3>
    <trait4>Reactive
The marilith can take one reaction on every turn in combat.</trait4>
    <action1>Multiattack
The marilith can make seven attacks: six with its longswords and one with its tail.</action1>
    <action2>Longsword
Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8+4) slashing damage.</action2>
    <action3>Tail
Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. Hit: 15 (2d10+4) bludgeoning damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it is grappled (escape DC 19). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, the marilith can automatically hit the target with its tail, and the marilith can't make tail attacks against other targets.



Grappled:

• A grappled creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.



• The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated.



• The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by the thunderwave spell.



Restrained:

• A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.



• The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.</action3>
    <action4>Teleport
The marilith magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.</action4>
    <action5>Variant: Summon Demon (1/Day)
The demon chooses what to summon and attempts a magical summoning.

	A marilith has a 50 percent chance of summoning 1d6 vrocks, 1d4 hezrous, 1d3 glabrezus, 1d2 nalfeshnees, or one marilith.

	A summoned demon appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of its summoner, acts as an ally of its summoner, and can't summon other demons. It remains for 1 minute, until it or its summoner dies, or until its summoner dismisses it as an action.</action5>

    <trait2>Earthen Defeat
When Marlos drops to 0 hit points, his body transforms into mud and collapses into a pool. Anything he is wearing or carrying is left behind.</trait2>
    <trait3>Earth Passage
Marlos can move in difficult terrain composed of anything made from earth or stone as if it were normal terrain. He can move through solid earth and rock as if it were difficult terrain. If he ends his turn there, he is shunted into the nearest space he last occupied.</trait3>
    <trait4>Legendary Resistance (2/Day)
If Marlos fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.</trait4>
    <trait5>Petrifying Gaze
When a creature that can see Marlos's eyes starts its turn within 30 feet of him, Marlos can force it to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw if Marlos isn't incapacitated and can see the creature. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is instantly petrified. Otherwise, a creature that fails the save begins to turn to stone and is restrained. The restrained creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts until the creature is freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.

	Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can't see Marlos until the start of its next turn, when it can decide to avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at Marlos in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.

	If Marlos sees himself reflected on a polished surface within 30 feet of him and in an area of bright light, Marlos is, due to his curse, affected by his own gaze.



Petrified:

• A petrified creature is transformed, along with any nonmagical object it is wearing or carrying, into a solid inanimate substance (usually stone). Its weight increases by a factor of ten, and it ceases aging.



• The creature is incapacitated (meaning it can't take actions or reactions), can't move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.



• The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.



• The creature has resistance to all damage.



• The creature is immune to poison and disease, although a poison or disease already in its system is suspended, not neutralized.



Restrained:

• A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.



• The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.</trait5>

    <trait2>Creature Sense
The neothelid is aware of the presence of creatures within 1 mile of it that have an Intelligence score of 4 or higher. It knows the distance and direction to each creature, as well as each creature’s Intelligence score, but can’t sense anything else about it. A creature protected by a mind blank spell, a nondetection spell, or similar magic can't be perceived in this manner.</trait2>
    <trait3>Innate Spellcasting (Psionics)
The neothelid’s innate spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 16). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no components:



At will: levitate



1/day each: confusion, feeblemind, telekinesis</trait3>
    <trait4>Magic Resistance
The neothelid has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</trait4>
    <action1>Tentacles
Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 21 (3d8+8) bludgeoning damage plus 13 (3d8) psychic damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be swallowed by the neothelid. A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the neothelid, and it takes 35 (10d6) acid damage at the start of each of the neothelid’s turns.

	If the neothelid takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the neothelid must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the neothelid. If the neothelid dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 20 feet of movement, exiting prone.



Blinded:

• A blinded creature can't see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.



Prone:

• A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.



• The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.



• An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.



Restrained:

• A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.



• The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.</action1>
    <action2>Acid Breath (Recharges 5-6)
The neothelid exhales acid in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 35 (10d6) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</action2>

    <trait2>Amphibious
The nereid can breathe air and water.</trait2>
    <trait3>Aquatic Invisibility
If immersed in water, the nereid can make itself invisible as a bonus action. It remains invisible until it leaves the water, ends the invisibility as a bonus action, or dies.</trait3>
    <trait4>Mantle Dependent
The nereid wears a mantle of silky cloth the color of sea foam, which holds the creature's spirit. The mantle has an AC and hit points equal to that of the nereid, but the garment can't be directly harmed while the nereid wears it. If the mantle is destroyed, the nereid becomes poisoned and dies within 1 hour. A nereid is willing to do anything in its power to recover the mantle if it is stolen, including serving the thief.</trait4>
    <trait5>Shape Water
The nereid can cast control water at will, requiring no components. Its spellcasting ability for it is Charisma. This use of the spell has a range of 30 feet and can affect a cube of water no larger than 30 feet on a side.</trait5>
    <trait6>Speak with Animals
The nereid can comprehend and verbally communicate with beasts.</trait6>
    <action1>Blinding Acid
Melee or Ranged Spell Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d12 + 3) acid damage, and the target is blinded until the start of the nereid's next turn.



Blinded:

• A blinded creature can't see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.</action1>
    <action2>Drowning Kiss (Recharge 5-6)
The nereid touches one creature it can see within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 22 (3d12 + 3) acid damage. On a failure, it also runs out of breath and can't speak for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns, it can repeat the save, ending the effect on itself on a success.</action2>
    <action3>Water Lash
The nereid causes a 5-foot cube of water within 60 feet of it to take a shape of its choice and strike one target it can see within 5 feet of that water. The target must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 17 (4d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage, and ifit is a Large or smaller creature, it is pushed up to 15 feet in a straight line or is knocked prone (nereid's choice). On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and isn't pushed or knocked prone.



Prone:

• A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.



• The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.



• An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.</action3>

    <trait2>Innate Spellcasting
The hag's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks). She can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:



	At will: detect magic, magic missile

	2/day each: plane shift (self only), ray of enfeeblement, sleep</trait2>
    <trait3>Magic Resistance
The hag has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</trait3>
    <trait4>Night Hag Items
A night hag carries two very rare magic items that she must craft for herself If either object is lost, the night hag will go to great lengths to retrieve it, as creating a new tool takes time and effort.

	Heartstone: This lustrous black gem allows a night hag to become ethereal while it is in her possession. The touch of a heartstone also cures any disease. Crafting a heartstone takes 30 days.

	Soul Bag: When an evil humanoid dies as a result of a night hag's Nightmare Haunting, the hag catches the soul in this black sack made of stitched flesh. A soul bag can hold only one evil soul at a time, and only the night hag who crafted the bag can catch a soul with it. Crafting a soul bag takes 7 days and a humanoid sacrifice (whose flesh is used to make the bag).</trait4>
    <trait5>Hag Coven
When hags must work together, they form covens, in spite of their selfish natures. A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of whom are equals within the group. However, each of the hags continues to desire more personal power.

	A coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two hags can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever come together, as might happen if two covens come into conflict, the result is usually chaos.</trait5>
    <trait6>Shared Spellcasting (Coven Only)
While all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard's spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves:



• 1st level (4 slots): identify, ray of sickness



• 2nd level (3 slots): hold person, locate object



• 3rd level (3 slots): bestow curse, counterspell, lightning bolt



• 4th level (3 slots): phantasmal killer, polymorph



• 5th level (2 slots): contact other plane, scrying



• 6th level (1 slot): eyebite



	For casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The spell save DC is 12+the hag's Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack bonus is 4+the hag's Intelligence modifier.</trait6>
    <trait7>Hag Eye (Coven Only)
A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.

	A hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.</trait7>
    <trait8>Variant: Death Coven
For a death coven, replace the spell list of the hags' Shared Spellcasting trait with the folllowing spells:



1st level (4 slots): false life, inflict wounds



2nd level (3 slots): gentle repose, ray of enfeeblement



3rd level (3 slots): animate dead, revivify, speak with dead



4th level (3 slots): blight, death ward



5th level (2 slots): contagion, raise dead



6th level (1 slot): circle of death</trait8>
    <trait9>Variant: Nature Coven
For a nature coven, replace the spell list of the hags' Shared Spellcasting trait with the folllowing spells:



1st level (4 slots): entangle, speak with animals



2nd level (3 slots): flaming sphere, moonbeam, spike growth



3rd level (3 slots): call lightning, plant growth



4th level (3 slots): dominate beast, grasping vine



5th level (2 slots): insect plague, tree stride



6th level (1 slot): wall of thorns</trait9>
    <trait10>Variant: Prophecy Coven
For a prophecy coven, replace the spell list of the hags' Shared Spellcasting trait with the folllowing spells:



1st level (4 slots): bane, bless



2nd level (3 slots): augury, detect thoughts



3rd level (3 slots): calirvoyance, dispel magic, nondetection



4th level (3 slots): arcane eye, locate creature



5th level (2 slots): geas, legend lore



6th level (1 slot): true seeing</trait10>
    <action1>Claws (Hag Form Only)
Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8+4) slashing damage.</action1>
    <action2>Change Shape
The hag magically polymorphs into a Small or Medium female humanoid, or back into her true form. Her statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment she is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. She reverts to her true form if she dies.</action2>
    <action3>Etherealness
The hag magically enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa. To do so, the hag must have a heartstone in her possession.</action3>
    <action4>Nightmare Haunting (1/Day)
While on the Ethereal Plane, the hag magically touches a sleeping humanoid on the Material Plane. A protection from evil and good spell cast on the target prevents this contact, as does a magic circle. As long as the contact persists, the target has dreadful visions. If these visions last for at least 1 hour, the target gains no benefit from its rest, and its hit point maximum is reduced by 5 (1d10). If this effect reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and if the target was evil, its soul is trapped in the hag's soul bag. The reduction to the target's hit point maximum lasts until removed by the greater restoration spell or similar magic.</action4>

    <trait2>Wand of Orcus
The wand has 7 charges, and any of its properties that require a saving throw have a save DC of 18. While holding it, Orcus can use an action to cast animate dead, blight, or speak with dead. Alternatively, he can expend or 1 or more of the wand's charges to cast one of the following spells from it: circle of death (1 charge), finger of death (1 charge), or power word kill (2 charges). The wand regains 1d4+3 charges daily at dawn.

	While holding the wand, Orcus can use an action to conjure undead creatures whose combined average hit points don't exceed 500. These undead magically rise up from the ground or otherwise form in unoccupied spaces within 300 feet of Orcus and obey his commands until they are destroyed or until he dismisses them as an action. Once this property of the wand is used, the property can't be used again until the next dawn.</trait2>
    <trait3>Innate Spellcasting
Orcus's spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 23, +15 to hit with spell attacks). He can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:



	At will: chill touch (17th level), detect magic

	3/day each: create undead, dispel magic

	1/day: time stop</trait3>
    <trait4>Legendary Resistance (3/Day)
If Orcus fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.</trait4>
    <trait5>Magic Resistance
Orcus has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</trait5>
    <trait6>Magic Weapon
Orcus's weapon attacks are magical.</trait6>
    <trait7>Master of Undeath
When Orcus casts animate dead or create undead, he chooses the level at which the spell is cast, and the creatures created by the spells remain under his control indefinitely. Additionally, he can cast create undead even when it isn't night.</trait7>
    <action1>Multiattack
Orcus makes two Wand of Orcus attacks.</action1>
    <action2>Wand of Orcus

    <legendary2>Tail
Orcus makes one tail attack.</legendary2>
    <legendary3>A Taste of Undeath
Orcus casts chill touch (17th level).</legendary3>
    <legendary4>Creeping Death (Costs 2 Actions)

    <trait2>Limited Telepathy
The otyugh can magically transmit simple messages and images to any creature within 120 ft. of it that can understand a language. This form of telepathy doesn't allow the receiving creature to telepathically respond.</trait2>
    <action1>Multiattack
The otyugh makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its tentacles.</action1>
    <action2>Bite
Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d8+3) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw against disease or become poisoned until the disease is cured. Every 24 hours that elapse, the target must repeat the saving throw, reducing its hit point maximum by 5 (1d10) on a failure. The disease is cured on a success. The target dies if the disease reduces its hit point maximum to 0. This reduction to the target's hit point maximum lasts until the disease is cured.



Poisoned:

• A poisoned creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.</action2>
    <action3>Tentacle
Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d8+3) bludgeoning damage plus 4 (1d8) piercing damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it is grappled (escape DC 13) and restrained until the grapple ends. The otyugh has two tentacles, each of which can grapple one target.



Grappled:

• A grappled creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.



• The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated.



• The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by the thunderwave spell.



Restrained:

• A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.



• The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.</action3>
    <action4>Tentacle Slam
The otyugh slams creatures grappled by it into each other or a solid surface. Each creature must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take 10 (2d6+3) bludgeoning damage and be stunned until the end of the otyugh's next turn. On a successful save, the target takes half the bludgeoning damage and isn't stunned.



Stunned:

• A stunned creature is incapacitated, meaning it can't take actions or reactions, can't move, and can speak only falteringly.



• The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.</action4>

	If the target is a creature, the poltergeist makes a Charisma check contested by the target's Strength check. If the poltergeist wins the contest, the poltergeist hurls the target up to 30 feet in any direction, including upward. If the target then comes into contact with a hard surface or heavy object, the target takes 1d6 damage per 10 feet moved.

	If the target is an object that isn't being worn or carried, the poltergeist hurls it up to 30 feet in any direction. The poltergeist can use the object as a ranged weapon, attacking one creature along the object's path (+4 to hit) and dealing 5 (2d4) bludgeoning damage on a hit.</action2>

    <action1>Multiattack
The worm makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its stinger.</action1>
    <action2>Bite
Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 22 (3d8+9) piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed by the worm. A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the worm, and it takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the worm's turns.

	If the worm takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the worm must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the worm. If the worm dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 20 feet of movement, exiting prone.



Blinded:

• A blinded creature can't see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.



Prone:

• A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.



• The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.



• An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.



Restrained:

• A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.



• The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.</action2>

    <trait3>Regeneration
The slaad regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point.</trait3>
    <trait4>Variant: Control Gem
Implanted in the slaad's brain is a magic control gem. The slaad must obey whoever possesses the gem and is immune to being charmed while so controlled.

	Certain spells can be used to acquire the gem. If the slaad fails its saving throw against imprisonment, the spell can transfer the gem to the spellcaster's open hand, instead of imprisoning the slaad. A wish spell, if cast in the slaad's presence, can be worded to acquire the gem.

	A greater restoration spell cast on the slaad destroys the gem without harming the slaad.

	Someone who is proficient in Wisdom (Medicine) can remove the gem from an incapacitated slaad. Each try requires 1 minute of uninterrupted work and a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Medicine) check. Each failed attempt deals 22 (4d10) psychic damage to the slaad.</trait4>
    <action1>Multiattack
The slaad makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.</action1>
    <action2>Bite
Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (2d4+3) piercing damage.</action2>
    <action3>Claw
Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d8+3) piercing damage. If the target is a humanoid, it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be infected with a disease — a minuscule slaad egg.

	A humanoid host can carry only one slaad egg to term at a time. Over three months, the egg moves to the chest cavity, gestates, and forms a slaad tadpole. In the 24-hour period before giving birth, the host starts to feel unwell, its speed is halved, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. At birth, the tadpole chews its way through vital organs and out of the host's chest in 1 round, killing the host in the process.

	If the disease is cured before the tadpole's emergence, the unborn slaad is disintegrated.</action3>

    <trait2>Heated Body
A creature that touches the remorhaz or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 10 (3d6) fire damage.</trait2>
    <action1>Bite
Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 40 (6d10+7) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) fire damage. If the target is a creature, it is grappled (escape DC 17). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the remorhaz can't bite another target.



Grappled:

• A grappled creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.



• The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated.



• The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by the thunderwave spell.



Restrained:

• A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.



• The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.</action1>
    <action2>Swallow
The remorhaz makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, that creature takes the bite's damage and is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the remorhaz, and it takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the remorhaz's turns.

	If the remorhaz takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the remorhaz must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet oft he remorhaz. If the remorhaz dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone.



Blinded:

• A blinded creature can't see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.



Prone:

• A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.



• The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.



• An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.



Restrained:

• A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.



• The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.</action2>

    <trait2>Regeneration
The revenant regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn. If the revenant takes fire or radiant damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of the revenant's next turn. The revenant's body is destroyed only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.</trait2>
    <trait3>Rejuvenation
When the revenant's body is destroyed, its soul lingers. After 24 hours, the soul inhabits and animates another corpse on the same plane of existence and regains all its hit points. While the soul is bodiless, a wish spell can be used to force the soul to go to the afterlife and not return.</trait3>
    <trait4>Turn Immunity
The revenant is immune to effects that turn undead.</trait4>
    <trait5>Vengeful Tracker
The revenant knows the distance to and direction of any creature against which it seeks revenge, even if the creature and the revenant are on different planes of existence. If the creature being tracked by the revenant dies, the revenant knows.</trait5>
    <action1>Multiattack
The revenant makes two fist attacks.</action1>
    <action2>Fist
Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6+4) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature against which the revenant has sworn vengeance, the target takes an extra 14 (4d6) bludgeoning damage. Instead of dealing damage, the revenant can grapple the target (escape DC 14) provided the target is Large or smaller.</action2>
    <action3>Vengeful Glare
The revenant targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it and against which it has sworn vengeance. The target must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the target is paralyzed until the revenant deals damage to it, or until the end of the revenant's next turn. When the paralysis ends, the target is frightened of the revenant for 1 minute. The frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if it can see the revenant, ending the frightened condition on itself on a success.



Frightened:

• A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight.



• The creature can't willingly move closer to the source of its fear.



Paralyzed:

• A paralyzed creature is incapacitated, meaning it can't take actions or reactions, and can't move or speak.



• The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.



• Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.</action3>

    <trait3>Horrific Appearance
Any humanoid that starts its turn within 30 feet of the hag and can see the hag's true form must make a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the hag is within line of sight, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the hag's Horrific Appearance for the next 24 hours.

	Unless the target is surprised or the revelation of the hag's true form is sudden, the target can avert its eyes and avoid making the initial saving throw. Until the start of its next turn, a creature that averts its eyes has disadvantage on attack rolls against the hag.



Frightened:

• A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight.



• The creature can't willingly move closer to the source of its fear.</trait3>
    <trait4>Hag Coven
When hags must work together, they form covens, in spite of their selfish natures. A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of whom are equals within the group. However, each of the hags continues to desire more personal power.

	A coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two hags can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever come together, as might happen if two covens come into conflict, the result is usually chaos.</trait4>
    <trait5>Shared Spellcasting (Coven Only)
While all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard's spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves:



• 1st level (4 slots): identify, ray of sickness



• 2nd level (3 slots): hold person, locate object



• 3rd level (3 slots): bestow curse, counterspell, lightning bolt



• 4th level (3 slots): phantasmal killer, polymorph



• 5th level (2 slots): contact other plane, scrying



• 6th level (1 slot): eyebite



	For casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The spell save DC is 12+the hag's Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack bonus is 4+the hag's Intelligence modifier.</trait5>
    <trait6>Hag Eye (Coven Only)
A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.

	A hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.</trait6>
    <trait7>Variant: Death Coven
For a death coven, replace the spell list of the hags' Shared Spellcasting trait with the folllowing spells:



1st level (4 slots): false life, inflict wounds



2nd level (3 slots): gentle repose, ray of enfeeblement



3rd level (3 slots): animate dead, revivify, speak with dead



4th level (3 slots): blight, death ward



5th level (2 slots): contagion, raise dead



6th level (1 slot): circle of death</trait7>
    <trait8>Variant: Nature Coven
For a nature coven, replace the spell list of the hags' Shared Spellcasting trait with the folllowing spells:



1st level (4 slots): entangle, speak with animals



2nd level (3 slots): flaming sphere, moonbeam, spike growth



3rd level (3 slots): call lightning, plant growth



4th level (3 slots): dominate beast, grasping vine



5th level (2 slots): insect plague, tree stride



6th level (1 slot): wall of thorns</trait8>
    <trait9>Variant: Prophecy Coven
For a prophecy coven, replace the spell list of the hags' Shared Spellcasting trait with the folllowing spells:



1st level (4 slots): bane, bless



2nd level (3 slots): augury, detect thoughts



3rd level (3 slots): calirvoyance, dispel magic, nondetection



4th level (3 slots): arcane eye, locate creature



5th level (2 slots): geas, legend lore



6th level (1 slot): true seeing</trait9>
    <action1>Claws
Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6+3) slashing damage.</action1>
    <action2>Death Glare
The hag targets one frightened creature she can see within 30 ft. of her. If the target can see the hag, it must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or drop to 0 hit points.</action2>
    <action3>Illusory Appearance
The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that makes her look like an ugly creature of her general size and humanoid shape. The effect ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies.

	The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have no claws, but someone touching her hand might feel the claws. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the hag is disguised.</action3>

Poison Quills. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 3 (1d6) poison damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

    <trait2>Lightning Absorption
Whenever the shambling mound is subjected to lightning damage, it takes no damage and regains a number of hit points equal to the lightning damage dealt.</trait2>
    <action1>Multiattack
The shambling mound makes two slam attacks. If both attacks hit a Medium or smaller target, the target is grappled (escape DC 14), and the shambling mound uses its Engulf on it.



Grappled:

• A grappled creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.



• The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated.



• The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by the thunderwave spell.</action1>
    <action2>Slam
Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8+4) bludgeoning damage.</action2>
    <action3>Engulf
The shambling mound engulfs a Medium or smaller creature grappled by it. The engulfed target is blinded, restrained, and unable to breathe, and it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw at the start of each of the mound's turns or take 13 (2d8+4) bludgeoning damage. If the mound moves, the engulfed target moves with it. The mound can have only one creature engulfed at a time.



Blinded:

• A blinded creature can't see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.



Restrained:

• A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.



• The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.</action3>

    <trait2>Regeneration
The spawn of Kyuss regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point and isn’t in sunlight or a body of running water. If the spawn takes acid, fire, or radiant damage, this trait doesn’t function at the start of the spawn's next turn. The spawn is destroyed only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn’t regenerate.</trait2>
    <trait3>Worms
If the spawn of Kyuss is targeted by an effect that cures disease or removes a curse, all the worms infesting it wither away, and it loses its Burrowing Worm action.</trait3>
    <action1>Multiattack
The spawn of Kyuss makes two attacks with its claws and uses Burrowing Worm.</action1>
    <action2>Burrowing Worm
A worm launches from the spawn of Kyuss at one humanoid that the spawn can see within 10 feet of it. The worm latches onto the target’s skin unless the target succeeds on a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw. The worm is a Tiny undead with AC 6, 1 hit point, a 2 (-4) in every ability score, and a speed of 1 foot. While on the target’s skin, the worm can be killed by normal means or scraped off using an action (the spawn can use this action to launch a scraped-off worm at a humanoid it can see within 10 feet of the worm). Otherwise, the worm burrows under the target’s skin at the end of the target's next turn, dealing l piercing damage to it. At the end of each of its turns thereafter, the target takes 7 (2d6) necrotic damage per worm infesting it (maximum of 10d6). A worm-infested target dies if it drops to 0 hit points, then rises 10 minutes later as a spawn of Kyuss. If a worm-infested creature is targeted by an effect that cures disease or removes a curse, all the worms infesting it wither away.</action2>

    <action2>Eye Rays
The spectator shoots up to two of the following magical eye rays at one or two creatures it can see within 90 ft. of it. It can use each ray only once on a turn.

	1. Confusion Ray. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw, or it can't take reactions until the end of its next turn. On its turn, the target can't move, and it uses its action to make a melee or ranged attack against a randomly determined creature within range. If the target can't attack, it does nothing on its turn.

	2. Paralyzing Ray. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

	3. Fear Ray. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the spectator is visible to the target, ending the effect on itself on a success.

	4. Wounding Ray. The target must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 16 (3d10) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.



Frightened:

• A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight.



• The creature can't willingly move closer to the source of its fear.



Paralyzed:

• A paralyzed creature is incapacitated, meaning it can't take actions or reactions, and can't move or speak.



• The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.

• The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.



• Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.</action2>
    <action3>Heart Sight
The sprite touches a creature and magically knows the creature's current emotional state. If the target fails a DC 10 Charisma saving throw, the sprite also knows the creature's alignment. Celestials, fiends, and undead automatically fail the saving throw.</action3>
    <action4>Invisibility
The sprite magically turns invisible until it attacks or casts a spell, or until its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment the sprite wears or carries is invisible with it.



Invisible:

• An invisible creature is impossible to see without the aid of magic or a special sense. For the purpose of hiding, the creature is heavily obscured. The creature's location can be detected by any noise it makes or any tracks it leaves.



• Attack rolls against the creature have disadvantage, and the creature's attack rolls have advantage.</action4>

Prone:

• A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.



• The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.



• An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.</action3>
    <action4>Variant: Fling
The giant tries to throw a Small or Medium creature within 10 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be hurled up to 60 feet horizontally in a direction of the giant's choice and land prone, taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown.

    <trait2>Dreamwalker's Charm
An enemy that starts its turn within 30 feet of the giant must make a DC 13 Charisma saving throw, provided that the giant isn’t incapacitated. On a failed save, the creature is charmed by the giant. A creature charmed in this way can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once it succeeds on the saving throw, the creature is immune to this giant’s Dreamwalker's Charm for 24 hours.



Charmed:

• A charmed creature can't attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects.

    <action3>Petrifying Touch
The giant touches one Medium or smaller creature within 10 feet of it that is charmed by it. The target must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target becomes petrified, and the giant can adhere the target to its stony body. Greater restoration spells and other magic that can undo petrification have no effect on a petrified creature on the giant unless the giant is dead, in which case the magic works normally, freeing the petrified creature as well as ending the petrified condition on it.



Petrified:

• A petrified creature is transformed, along with any nonmagical object it is wearing or carrying, into a solid inanimate substance (usually stone). Its weight increases by a factor of ten, and it ceases aging.



• The creature is incapacitated (meaning it can't take actions or reactions), can't move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.



• The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.



• The creature has resistance to all damage.



• The creature is immune to poison and disease, although a poison or disease already in its system is suspended, not neutralized.</action3>

Prone:

• A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.



• The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.

Curse of Strahd p. 239</trait1>
    <trait2>Shapechanger
If Strahd isn't in running water or sunlight, he can use his action to polymorph into a Tiny bat, a Medium wolf, or a Medium cloud of mist, or back into his true form.

	While in bat or wolf form, Strahd can't speak. In bat form, his walking speed is 5 feet, and he has a flying speed of 30 feet. In wolf form, his walking speed is 40 feet. His statistics, other than his size and speed, are unchanged. Anything he is wearing transforms with him, but nothing he is carrying does. He reverts to his true form if he dies.

	While in mist form, Strahd can't take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. He is weightless, has a flying speed of 30 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without squeezing, and he can't pass through water. He has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, and it is immune to all nonmagical damage, except the damage he takes from sunlight.</trait2>
    <trait3>Legendary Resistance (3/Day)
If Strahd fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.</trait3>
    <trait4>Misty Escape
When he drops to 0 hit points outside his coffin, Strahd transforms into a cloud of mist (as in the Shapechanger trait) instead of falling unconscious, provided that he isn't in running water or sunlight. If he can't transform, he is destroyed.

	While he has 0 hit points in mist form, he can't revert to his vampire form, and he must reach his coffin within 2 hours or be destroyed. Once in his coffin, he reverts to his vampire form. He is then paralyzed until he regains at least 1 hit point. After spending 1 hour in his coffin with 0 hit points, he regains 1 hit point.</trait4>
    <trait5>Regeneration
Strahd regains 20 hit points at the start of his turn if he has at least 1 hit point and isn't in running water or sunlight. If he takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn't function at the start of his next turn.</trait5>
    <trait6>Spellcasting
Strahd is a 9th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 18, +10 to hit with spell attacks). Strahd has the following wizard spells prepared:



• Cantrips (at will): mage hand, prestidigitation, ray of frost



•1st level (4 slots): comprehend languages, fog cloud, sleep



•2nd level (3 slots): detect thoughts, gust of wind, mirror image



•3rd level (3 slots): animate dead, fireball, nondetection



•4th level (3 slots): blight, greater invisibility, polymorph



•5th level (1 slot): animate objects, scrying</trait6>
    <trait7>Spider Climb
Strahd can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.</trait7>
    <trait8>Vampire Weaknesses
Strahd has the following flaws.

	Forbiddance: He can't enter a residence without an invitation from one of the occupants.

	Harmed by Running Water: He takes 20 acid damage if he ends his turn in running water.

	Stake to the Heart: If a piercing weapon made of wood is driven into his heart while he is incapacitated in his coffin, he is paralyzed until the stake is removed.

	Sunlight Hypersensitivity: While in sunlight, Strahd takes 20 radiant damage at the start of his turn, and he has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.</trait8>
    <action1>Multiattack (Vampire Form Only)
Strahd makes two attacks, only one of which can be a bite attack.</action1>
    <action2>Unarmed Strike (Vampire Form Only)
Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 8 (1d8+4) bludgeoning damage, plus 14 (4d6) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, Strahd can grapple it (escape DC 18) instead of dealing the bludgeoning damage.</action2>
    <action3>Bite (Bat or Vampire Form Only)
Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one willing creature, or a creature that is grappled by Strahd, incapacitated, or restrained. Hit: 7 (1d6+4) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and Strahd regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if  its hit point maximum is reduced to 0. A humanoid slain in this way and then buried in the ground rises the following night as a vampire spawn under Strahd's control.</action3>
    <action4>Charm
Strahd targets one humanoid he can see within 30 ft. of him. If the target can see Strahd, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or be charmed. The charmed target regards Strahd as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. The target isn't under Strahd's control, but it takes Strahd's requests and actions in the most favorable way and lets Strahd bite it.

	Each time Strahd or his companions do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until Strahd is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or takes a bonus action to end the effect.</action4>
    <action5>Children of the Night (1/day)
Strahd magically calls 2d4 swarms of bats or swarms rats, provided that the sun isn't up. While outdoors, Strahd can call 3d6 wolves instead. The called creatures arrive in 1d4 rounds, acting as allies of Strahd and obeying his spoken commands. The beasts remain for 1 hour, until Strahd dies, or until he dismisses them as a bonus action.</action5>
    <legendary1>Legendary Actions (3/Turn)
Strahd can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time, and only at the end of another creature's turn. Strahd regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.</legendary1>
    <legendary2>Move
Strahd moves up to his speed without provoking opportunity attacks.</legendary2>
    <legendary3>Unarmed Strike
Strahd makes one unarmed strike.</legendary3>
    <legendary4>Bite (Costs 2 Actions)
Strahd makes one bite attack.</legendary4>

    <trait2>Loathsome Limbs
Whenever the zombie takes at least 5 bludgeoning or slashing damage at one time, roll a d20 to determine what else happens to it:



1-8: One leg is severed from the zombie if it has any legs left.



9-16: One arm is severed from the zombie if it has any arms left.



17-20: The zombie is decapitated.



	If the zombie is reduced to 0 hit points, all parts of it die. Until then, a severed part acts on the zombie's initiative and has its own action and movement. A severed part has AC 8. Any damage it takes is subtracted from the zombie's hit points.

	A severed leg is unable to attack and has a speed of 5 feet.

	A severed arm has a speed of 5 feet and can make one claw attack on its turn, with disadvantage on the attack roll. Each time the zombie loses an arm, it loses a claw attack.

	If its head is severed, the zombie loses its bite attack and its body is blinded unless the head can see it. The severed head has a speed of 0 feet. It can make a bite attack but only against a target in its space.

	The zombie's speed is halved if it's missing a leg. If it loses both legs, it falls prone. If it has both arms, it can crawl. With only one arm, it can still crawl, but its speed is halved. With no arms or legs, its speed is 0, and it can't benefit from bonuses to speed.</trait2>
    <action1>Multiattack
The zombie makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.</action1>
    <action2>Bite
Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 3 (1d4+1) piercing damage.</action2>

An animated object doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

	The magic that animates an object is dispelled when the construct drops to 0 hit points. An animated object reduced to 0 hit points becomes inanimate and is too damaged to be of much use or value to anyone.</trait2>
    <trait3>Antimagic Susceptibility
The armor is incapacitated while in the area of an antimagic field. If targeted by dispel magic, the armor must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against the caster's spell save DC or fall unconscious for 1 minute.</trait3>

    <action4>Psychic Crush (Recharge 5-6)
The su-monster targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or take 17 (5d6) psychic damage and be stunned for 1 minute. The stunned target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.



Stunned:

    <trait3>Shapechanger
The fiend can use its action to polymorph into a Small or Medium humanoid, or back into its true form. Without wings, the fiend loses its flying speed.

One humanoid the fiend can see within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed for 1 day. The charmed target obeys the fiend's verbal or telepathic commands. If the target suffers any harm or receives a suicidal command, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. If the target successfully saves against the effect, or if the effect on it ends, the target is immune to this fiend's Charm for the next 24 hours.

	The fiend can have only one target charmed at a time. If it charms another, the effect on the previous target ends.

Melee Weapon Attack: +0 to hit, reach 0 ft., one creature in the swarm’s space. Hit: The target is infested by 1d4 rot grubs. At the start of each of the target’s turns, the target takes 1d6 piercing damage per rot grub infesting it. Applying fire to the bite wound before the end of the target's next turn deals 1 fire damage to the target and kills these rot grubs. After this time, these rot grubs are too far under the skin to be burned. If a target infested by rot grubs ends its turn with 0 hit points, it dies as the rot grubs burrow into its heart and kill it. Any effect that cures disease kills all rot grubs infesting the target.</action1>

    <trait2>Legendary Resistance (3/Day)
If the tarrasque fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.</trait2>
    <trait3>Magic Resistance
The tarrasque has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</trait3>
    <trait4>Reflective Carapace
Any time the tarrasque is targeted by a magic missile spell, a line spell, or a spell that requires a ranged attack roll, roll a d6. On a 1 to 5, the tarrasque is unaffected. On a 6, the tarrasque is unaffected, and the effect is reflected back at the caster as though it originated from the tarrasque, turning the caster into the target.</trait4>
    <trait5>Siege Monster
The tarrasque deals double damage to objects and structures.</trait5>
    <action1>Multiattack
The tarrasque can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes five attacks: one with its bite, two with its claws, one with its horns, and one with its tai l. It can use its Swallow instead of its bite.</action1>
    <action2>Bite
Melee Weapon Attack: +19 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 36 (4d12+10) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it is grappled (escape DC 20). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the tarrasque can't bite another target.



Grappled:

• A grappled creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.



• The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated.



• The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by the thunderwave spell.



Restrained:

• A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.



• The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.</action2>
    <action3>Claw
Melee Weapon Attack: +19 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 28 (4d8+10) slashing damage.</action3>
    <action4>Horns
Melee Weapon Attack: +19 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 32 (4d10+10) piercing damage.</action4>
    <action5>Tail
Melee Weapon Attack: +19 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 24 (4d6+10) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.



Prone:

• A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.



• The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.



• An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.</action5>
    <action6>Frightful Presence
Each creature of the tarrasque's choice within 120 feet of it and aware of it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the tarrasque is within line of sight, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the tarrasque's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.



Frightened:

• A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight.



• The creature can't willingly move closer to the source of its fear.</action6>
    <action7>Swallow
The tarrasque makes one bite attack against a Large or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target takes the bite's damage, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the tarrasque, and it takes 56 (16d6) acid damage at the start of each of the tarrasque's turns.

	If the tarrasque takes 60 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the tarrasque must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the tarrasque. If the tarrasque dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 30 feet of movement, exiting prone.



Blinded:

• A blinded creature can't see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.



Prone:

• A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.



• The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.



• An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.



Restrained:

• A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.



• The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.</action7>
    <legendary1>Legendary Actions (3/Turn)
The tarrasque can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time, and only at the end of another creature's turn. The tarrasque regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.</legendary1>

The tlincalli makes two attacks: one with its longsword or spiked chain, and one with its sting.</action1>
    <action2>Longsword
Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d8+3) slashing damage, or 8 (1d10+3) slashing damage if used with two hands.</action2>
    <action3>Spiked Chain
Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6+3) piercing damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 11) if it is a Large or smaller creature. Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the tlincalli can’t use the spiked chain against another target.



Grappled:

• A grappled creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.



• The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated.



• The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by the thunderwave spell.



Restrained:

• A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.



• The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.</action3>
    <action4>Sting
Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 (1d6+3) piercing damage plus 14 (4d6) poison damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. If it fails the saving throw by 5 or more, the target is also paralyzed while poisoned. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.



Paralyzed:

• A paralyzed creature is incapacitated, meaning it can't take actions or reactions, and can't move or speak.



• The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.



• Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.

    <trait2>Fake Appearance
While the trapper is attached to a ceiling, floor, or wall and remains motionless, it is almost indistinguishable from an ordinary section of ceiling, floor, or wall. A creature that can see it and succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence (investigation) or Intelligence (Nature) check can discern its presence.</trait2>
    <trait3>Spider Climb
The trapper can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.</trait3>
    <action1>Smother
One Large or smaller creature within 5 feet of the trapper must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or be grappled (escape DC 14). Until the grapple ends, the target takes 17 (4d6+3) bludgeoning damage plus 3 (1d6) acid damage at the start of each of its turns. While grappled in this way, the target is restrained, blinded, and at risk of suffocating. The trapper can smother only one creature at a time.



Blinded:

• A blinded creature can't see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.



Grappled:

• A grappled creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.



• The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated.



• The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by the thunderwave spell.



Restrained:

• A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.



• The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.</action1>

These trees have the same statistics as a treant, except they have Intelligence and Charisma scores of 1, they can't speak, and they have only the Slam action option. An animated tree acts as an ally of the treant. The tree remains animate for 1 day or until it dies; until the treant dies or is more than 120 feet from the tree; or until the treant takes a bonus action to turn it back into an inanimate tree.

The tri-flower frond uses its orange blossom, then its yellow blossom, and then its red blossom.</action1>
    <action2>Orange Blossom
The tri-flower frond chooses one creature it can see within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. While poisoned in this way, the target is unconscious. At the end of each minute, the poisoned target can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.



Poisoned:

• A poisoned creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.



Unconscious:

• An unconscious creature is incapacitated, meaning it can't take actions or reactions, can't move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings.



• The creature drops whatever it's holding and falls prone.



• The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.



• Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.</action2>
    <action3>Yellow Blossom
The tri-flower frond chooses one creature it can see within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw, or it is covered with corrosive sap and takes 5 acid damage at the start of each of its turns. Dousing the target with water reduces the acid damage by 1 point per pint or flask of water used.</action3>
    <action4>Red Blossom
Melee Weapon Attack: +2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 2 (1d4) piercing damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 11). Until this grapple ends, the target takes 5 (2d4) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. The red blossom can grapple only one target at a time. Another creature within reach of the tri-flower frond can use its action to end the grapple on the target.



Grappled:

• A grappled creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.



• The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated.



• The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by the thunderwave spell.</action4>

    <trait2>Keen Smell
The troll has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.</trait2>
    <trait3>Regeneration
The troll regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn. If the troll takes acid or fire damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of the troll's next turn. The troll dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.</trait3>
    <trait4>Variant: Loathsome Limbs
Whenever the troll takes at least 15 slashing damage at one time, roll a d20 to determine what else happens to it:

	1-10: Nothing else happens.

	11-14: One leg is severed from the troll if it has any legs left.

	15- 18: One arm is severed from the troll if it has any arms left.

	19-20: The troll is decapitated, but the troll dies only if it can't regenerate. If it dies, so does the severed head.

	If the troll finishes a short or long rest without reattaching a severed limb or head, the part regrows. At that point, the severed part dies. Until then, a severed part acts on the troll's initiative and has its own action and movement. A severed part has AC 13, 10 hit points, and the troll's Regeneration trait.

	A severed leg is unable to attack and has a speed of 5 feet.

	A severed arm has a speed of 5 feet and can make one claw attack on its turn, with disadvantage on the attack roll unless the troll can see the arm and its target. Each time the troll loses an arm, it loses a claw attack.

	If its head is severed, the troll loses its bite attack and its body is blinded unless the head can see it. The severed head has a speed of 0 feet and the troll's Keen Smell trait. It can make a bite attack but only against a target in its space.

	The troll's speed is halved if it's missing a leg. If it loses both legs, it falls prone. If it has both arms, it can crawl. With only one arm, it can still crawl, but its speed is halved. With no arms or legs, its speed is 0, and it can't benefit from bonuses to speed.



Blinded:

• A blinded creature can't see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.



Prone:

• A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.



• The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.



• An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.</trait4>

    <trait2>Disgorge Zombie
As a bonus action, the tyrannosaurus zombie can disgorge a normal zombie, which appears in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of it. The disgorged zombie acts on its own initiative count. After a zombie is disgorged, roll a d6. On a roll of 1, the tyrannosaurus zombie runs out of zombies to disgorge and loses this trait. If the tyrannosaurus zombie still has this trait when it dies, 1d4 normal zombies erupt from its corpse at the start of its next turn. These zombies act on their own initiative count.</trait2>
    <trait3>Undead Fortitude
If damage reduces the tyrannosaurus zombie to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the zombie drops to 1 hit point instead.</trait3>

    <trait2>Creature Sense
The ulitharid is aware of the presence of creatures within 2 miles of it that have an Intelligence score of 4 or higher. It knows the distance and direction to each creature, as well as each creature’s intelligence score, but can't sense anything else about it. A creature protected by a mind blank spell, a nondetection spell, or similar magic can’t be perceived in this manner.</trait2>
    <trait3>Magic Resistance
The ulitharid has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</trait3>
    <trait4>Psionic Hub
If an elder brain establishes a psychic link with the ulitharid, the elder brain can form a psychic link with any other creature the ulitharid can detect using its Creature Sense. Any such link ends if the creature falls outside the telepathy ranges of both the ulitharid and the elder brain. The ulitharid can maintain its psychic link with the elder brain regardless of the distance between them, so long as they are both on the same plane of existence. lithe ulitharid is more than 5 miles away from the elder brain, it can end the psychic link at any time (no action required).</trait4>
    <trait5>Innate Spellcasting (Psionics)
The ulitharid’s innate spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 17). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no components:



At will: detect thoughts, levitate



1/day each: confusion, dominate monster, eyebite, feeblemind, mass suggestion, plane shift (self only), project image, scrying, telekinesis</trait5>
    <action1>Tentacles
Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. Hit: 27 (4d10+5) psychic damage. If the target is Large or smaller, it is grappled (escape DC 14) and must succeed on a DC 17 Intelligence saving throw or be stunned until this grapple ends.



Grappled:

• A grappled creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.



• The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated.



• The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by the thunderwave spell.



Stunned:

• A stunned creature is incapacitated, meaning it can't take actions or reactions, can't move, and can speak only falteringly.



• The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.</action1>
    <action2>Extract Brain
Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one incapacitated humanoid grappled by the ulitharid. Hit: 55 (10d10) piercing damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the ulitharid kills the target by extracting and devouring its brain.</action2>
    <action3>Mind Blast (Recharge 5-6)
The ulitharid magically emits psychic energy in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 17 Intelligence saving throw or take 31 (4d12+5) psychic damage and be stunned for 1 minute. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

    <trait2>Confusing Gaze
When a creature starts its turn within 30 feet of the umber hulk and is able to see the umber hulk's eyes, the umber hulk can magically force it to make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw, unless the umber hulk is incapacitated.

	On a failed saving throw, the creature can't take reactions until the start of its next turn and rolls a d8 to determine what it does during that turn. On a 1 to 4, the creature does nothing. On a 5 or 6, the creature takes no action but uses all its movement to move in a random direction. On a 7 or 8, the creature makes one melee attack against a random creature, or it does nothing if no creature is within reach.

	Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can't see the umber hulk until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the umber hulk in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.</trait2>

    <trait2>Shapechanger
If the vampire isn't in sun light or running water, it can use its action to polymorph into a Tiny bat or a Medium cloud of mist, or back into its true form.

	While in bat form, the vampire can't speak, its walking speed is 5 feet, and it has a flying speed of 30 feet. Its statistics, other than its size and speed, are unchanged. Anything it is wearing transforms with it, but nothing it is carrying does. It reverts to its true form if it dies.

	While in mist form, the vampire can't take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. It is weightless, has a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without squeezing, and it can't pass through water. It has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, and it is immune to all nonmagical damage, except the damage it takes from sunlight.</trait2>
    <trait3>Legendary Resistance (3/Day)
If the vampire fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.</trait3>
    <trait4>Misty Escape
When it drops to 0 hit points outside its resting place, the vampire transforms into a cloud of mist (as in the Shapechanger trait) instead of falling unconscious, provided that it isn't in sunlight or running water. If it can't transform, it is destroyed.

	While it has 0 hit points in mist form, it can't revert to its vampire form, and it must reach its resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed. Once in its resting place, it reverts to its vampire form. It is then paralyzed until it regains at least 1 hit point. After spending 1 hour in its resting place with 0 hit points, it regains 1 hit point.



Paralyzed:

• A paralyzed creature is incapacitated, meaning it can't take actions or reactions, and can't move or speak.



• The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.



• Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.</trait4>
    <trait5>Regeneration
The vampire regains 20 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point and isn't in sunlight or running water. If the vampire takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn't function at the start of the vampire's next turn.</trait5>
    <trait6>Spider Climb
The vampire can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.</trait6>
    <trait7>Vampire Weaknesses
The vampire has the following flaws.

	Forbiddance: The vampire can't enter a residence without an invitation from one of the occupants.

	Harmed by Running Water: The vampire takes 20 acid damage if it ends its turn in running water.

	Stake to the Heart: If a piercing weapon made of wood is driven into the vampire's heart while the vampire is incapacitated in its resting place, the vampire is paralyzed until the stake is removed.

	Sunlight Hypersensitivity: The vampire takes 20 radiant damage when it starts its turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.



Paralyzed:

• A paralyzed creature is incapacitated, meaning it can't take actions or reactions, and can't move or speak.



• The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.



• Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.</trait7>
    <action1>Multiattack (Vampire Form Only)
The vampire makes two attacks, only one of which can be a bite attack.</action1>
    <action2>Unarmed Strike (Vampire Form Only)
Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 8 (1d8+4) bludgeoning damage. Instead of dealing damage, the vampire can grapple the target (escape DC 18).</action2>
    <action3>Bite (Bat or Vampire Form Only)
Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one willing creature, or a creature that is grappled by the vampire, incapacitated, or restrained. Hit: 7 (1d6+4) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the vampire regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. A humanoid slain in this way and then buried in the ground rises the following night as a vampire spawn under the vampire's control.</action3>
    <action4>Charm
The vampire targets one humanoid it can see within 30 ft. of it. If the target can see the vampire, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or be charmed by the vampire. The charmed target regards the vampire as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn't under the vampire's control, it takes the vampire's requests or actions in the most favorable way it can, and it is a willing target for the vampire's bit attack.

	Each time the vampire or the vampire's companions do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the vampire is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or takes a bonus action to end the effect.



Charmed:

• A charmed creature can't attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects.



• The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature.</action4>
    <action5>Children of the Night (1/Day)
The vampire magically calls 2d4 swarms of bats or rats, provided that the sun isn't up. While outdoors, the vampire can call 3d6 wolves instead. The called creatures arrive in 1d4 rounds, acting as allies of the vampire and obeying its spoken commands. The beasts remain for 1 hour, until the vampire dies, or until the vampire dismisses them as a bonus action.</action5>
    <legendary1>Legendary Actions (3/Turn)
The vampire can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time, and only at the end of another creature's turn. The vampire regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.</legendary1>
    <legendary2>Move
The vampire moves up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.</legendary2>
    <legendary3>Unarmed Strike
The vampire makes one unarmed strike.</legendary3>

    <action2>Kiss
The vargouille kisses one incapacitated humanoid within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Charisma saving throw or become cursed. The cursed target loses 1 point of Charisma after each hour, as its head takes on fiendish aspects. The curse doesn’t advance while the target is in sunlight or the area of a daylight spell; don’t count that time. When the cursed target’s Charisma becomes 2, it dies, and its head tears from its body and becomes a new vargouille. Casting remove curse, greater restoration, or a similar spell on the target before the transformation is complete can end the curse. Doing so undoes the changes made to the target by the curse.</action2>
    <action3>Stunning Shriek
The vargouille shrieks. Each humanoid and beast within 30 feet of the vargouille and able to hear it must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the end of the vargouille’s next turn. While frightened in this way, a target is stunned. If a target’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for ft., the target is immune to the Stunning Shriek of all vargouilles for 1 hour.



Frightened:

• A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight.



• The creature can't willingly move closer to the source of its fear.



Stunned:

• A stunned creature is incapacitated, meaning it can't take actions or reactions, can't move, and can speak only falteringly.



• The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.</action3>

    <trait2>Magic Resistance
The vrock has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</trait2>
    <action1>Multiattack
The vrock makes two attacks: one with its beak and one with its talons.</action1>
    <action2>Beak
Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6+3) piercing damage.</action2>
    <action3>Talons
Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d10+3) slashing damage.</action3>
    <action4>Spores (Recharge 6)
A 15-foot-radius cloud of toxic spores extends out from the vrock. The spores spread around corners. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned. While poisoned in this way, a target takes 5 (1d10) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Emptying a vial of holy water on the target also ends the effect on it.



Poisoned:

• A poisoned creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.</action4>
    <action5>Stunning Screech (1/Day)
The vrock emits a horrific screech. Each creature within 20 feet of it that can hear it and that isn't a demon must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of the vrock's next turn .



Stunned:

• A stunned creature is incapacitated, meaning it can't take actions or reactions, can't move, and can speak only falteringly.



• The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.</action5>
    <action6>Variant: Summon Demon (1/Day)
The demon chooses what to summon and attempts a magical summoning.

	A vrock has a 30 percent chance of summoning 2d4 dretches or one vrock.

	A summoned demon appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of its summoner, acts as an ally of its summoner, and can't summon other demons. It remains for 1 minute, until it or its summoner dies, or until its summoner dismisses it as an action.</action6>

    <trait2>Invisible in Water
The water weird is invisible while fully immersed in water.



Invisible:

• An invisible creature is impossible to see without the aid of magic or a special sense. For the purpose of hiding, the creature is heavily obscured. The creature's location can be detected by any noise it makes or any tracks it leaves.



• Attack rolls against the creature have disadvantage, and the creature's attack rolls have advantage.</trait2>
    <trait3>Water Bound
The water weird dies if it leaves the water to which it is bound or if that water is destroyed.</trait3>
    <action1>Constrict
Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. Hit: 13 (3d6+3) bludgeoning damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it is grappled (escape DC 13) and pulled 5 ft. toward the water weird. Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, the water weird tries to drown it, and the water weird can't constrict another target.



Grappled:

• A grappled creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.



• The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated.



• The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by the thunderwave spell.



Restrained:

• A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.



• The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.</action1>

    <trait3>Possession (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest)
The yakfolk attempts to magically possess a humanoid or giant. The yakfolk must touch the target throughout a short rest, or the attempt fails. At the end of the rest, the target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be possessed by the yakfolk, which disappears with everything it is carrying and wearing. Until the possession ends, the target is incapacitated, loses control of its body, and is unaware of its surroundings. The yakfolk now controls the body and can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, and it retains its alignment; its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores; and its proficiencies. It otherwise uses the target's statistics, except the target's knowledge, class features, feats, and proficiencies.

	The possession lasts until either the body drops to O hit points, the yakfolk ends the possession as an action, or the yakfolk is forced out of the body by an effect such as the dispel evil and good spell. When the possession ends, the yakfolk reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the body and is stunned until the end of its next turn. If the host body dies while it is possessed by the yakfolk, the yakfolk dies as well, and its body doesn't reappear.</trait3>

While the creeper remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from an ordinary flowering vine.</trait2>
    <trait3>Regeneration
The creeper regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn. If the creeper takes fire, necrotic, or radiant damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of its next turn. The creeper dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.</trait3>
    <action1>Touch
Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 13 (3d8) psychic damage. If the target is a humanoid that drops to 0 hit points as a result of this damage, it dies and is implanted with a yellow musk creeper bulb. Unless the bulb is destroyed, the corpse animates as a yellow musk zombie after being dead for 24 hours. The bulb is destroyed if the creature is raised from the dead before it can transform into a yellow musk zombie, or if the corpse is targeted by a remove curse spell or similar magic before it animates.</action1>
    <action2>Yellow Musk (3/Day)
The creeper's flowers release a strong musk that targets all humanoids within 30 feet of it. Each target must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the creeper for 1 minute. A creature charmed in this way does nothing on its turn except move as close as it can to the creeper. A creature charmed by the creeper can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Yestabrod releases spores in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 acid damage at the start of each of Yestabrod's turns. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turn, ending the effect on itself on a success.</action2>

Yestabrod releases spores that burst out in a cloud that fills a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on it, and the cloud lingers for 1 minute. Any flesh-and-blood creature in the cloud when it appears, or that enters it later, must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the creature can't be infected by these spores for 24 hours. On a failed save, the creature is infected with a disease called the spores of Zuggtmoy and also gains a random form of indefinite madness (determined by rolling on the Madness of Zuggtmoy table in appendix D) that lasts until the creature is cured of the disease or dies. While infected in this way, the creature can't be reinfected, and it must be repeat the saving throw at the end of every 24 hours, ending the infection on a success. On a failure, the infected creature's body is slowly taken over by fungal growth, and after three such failed saves, the creature dies and is reanimated as a spore servant if it's a type of creature that can be (see the "Myconids" entry in the Monster Manual).</action3>

    <trait2>Keen Hearing and Smell
The yeth hound has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.</trait2>
    <trait3>Sunlight Banishment
If the yeth hound starts its turn in sunlight, it is transported to the Ethereal Plane. While sunlight shines on the spot from which it vanished, the hound must remain in the Deep Ethereal. After sunset, it returns to the Border Ethereal at the same spot, whereupon it typically sets out to find its pack or its master. The hound is visible on the Material Plane while it is in the Border Ethereal, and vice versa, but it can’t affect or be affected by anything on the other plane. Once it is adjacent to its master or a pack mate that is on the Material Plane, a yeth hound in the Border Ethereal can return to the Material Plane as an action.</trait3>
    <trait4>Telepathic Bond
While the yeth hound is on the same plane of existence as its master, it can magically convey what it senses to its master, and the two can communicate telepathically with each other.</trait4>
    <action1>Bite
Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6+4) piercing damage, plus 14 (4d6) psychic damage if the target is frightened.</action1>
    <action2>Baleful Baying
The yeth hound bays magically. Every enemy within 300 feet of the hound that can hear it must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the end of the hound’s next turn or until the hound is incapacitated. A frightened target that starts its turn within 30 feet of the hound must use all its movement on that turn to get as far from the hound as possible, must finish the move before taking an action, and must take the most direct route, even if hazards lie that way. A target that successfully saves is immune to the baying of all yeth hounds for the next 24 hours.



Frightened:

• A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight.



• The creature can't willingly move closer to the source of its fear.</action2>

    <trait2>Fear of Fire
If the yeti takes fire damage, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the end of its next turn.</trait2>
    <trait3>Keen Smell
The yeti has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.</trait3>
    <trait4>Snow Camouflage
The yeti has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in snowy terrain.</trait4>
    <action1>Multiattack
The yeti can use its Chilling Gaze and makes two claw attacks.</action1>
    <action2>Claw
Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6+4) slashing damage plus 3 (1d6) cold damage.</action2>
    <action3>Chilling Gaze
The yeti targets one creature it can see within 30 ft. of it. If the target can see the yeti, the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw against this magic or take 10 (3d6) cold damage and then be paralyzed for 1 minute, unless it is immune to cold damage. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If the target's saving throw is successful, or if the effect ends on it, the target is immune to the Chilling Gaze of all yetis (but not abominable yetis) for 1 hour.



Paralyzed:

• A paralyzed creature is incapacitated, meaning it can't take actions or reactions, and can't move or speak.



• The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.



• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.



• Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.</action3>

    <trait2>Shapechanger
The yochlol can use its action to polymorph into a form that resembles a female drow or giant spider, or back into its true form. Its statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.</trait2>
    <trait3>Magic Resistance
The yochlol has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</trait3>
    <trait4>Spider Climb
The yochlol can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.</trait4>
    <trait5>Innate Spellcasting
The yochlol's spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14). The yochlol can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

	At will: detect thoughts, web

	1/day: dominate person</trait5>
    <trait6>Web Walker
The yochlol ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing.</trait6>
    <action1>Multiattack
The yochlol makes two melee attacks.</action1>
    <action2>Slam (Bite in Spider Form)
Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft. (10 ft. in demon form}, one target. Hit: 5 (1d6+2) bludgeoning (piercing in spider form) damage plus 21 (6d6) poison damage.</action2>
    <action3>Mist Form
The yochlol transforms into toxic mist or reverts to its true form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is also transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.

	While in mist form, the yochlol is incapacitated and can't speak. It has a flying speed of 30 feet, can hover, and can pass through any space that isn't airtight. It has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, and it is immune to nonmagical damage.

	While in mist form, the yochlol can enter a creature's space and stop there. Each time that creature starts its turn with the yochlol in its space, the creature must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of its next turn. While poisoned in this way, the target is incapacitated.



Incapacitated:

• An incapacitated creature can't take actions or reactions.



Poisoned:

• A poisoned creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.</action3>
    <action4>Variant: Summon Demon (1/Day)
The demon chooses what to summon and attempts a magical summoning.

	A yochlol has a 50 percent chance of summoning one yochlol.

	A summoned demon appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of its summoner, acts as an ally of its summoner, and can't summon other demons. It remains for 1 minute, until it or its summoner dies, or until its summoner dismisses it as an action.</action4>

On a successful save, the creature can't be infected by these spores for 24 hours. On a failed save, the creature is infected with a disease called the spores of Zuggtmoy and also gains a random form of madness (determined by rolling on the Madness of Zuggtmoy table) that lasts until the creature is cured of the disease or dies. While infected in this way, the creature can't be reinfected, and it must repeat the saving throw at the end of every 24 hours, ending the infection on a success. On a failure, the infected creature's body is slowly taken over by fungal growth, and after three such failed saves, the creature dies and is reanimated as a spore servant if it's a type of creature that can be (see the "Myconids" entry in the Monster Manual).</action3>
