    <itemDetail>Wondrous item, uncommon</itemDetail>
    <text>This black stone phial has a tightly-fitting stopper. The phial has 3 charges. As an action, you can fill the phial with blood taken from a living humanoid, or one that’s been dead no longer than 1 minute, and expend 1 charge. When you do so, the black phial transforms the blood into a potion of greater healing. A creature who drinks this potion must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour.
	
	The phial regains 1d3 expended charges daily at midnight. If you expend the phial’s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the phial crumbles into dust and is destroyed.

    <itemDetail>Ring, uncommon (requires attunement)</itemDetail>
    <text>This brass clockwork ring is formed to look like a coiled dragon. When you speak or whisper the draconic command word etched on the inside of the ring, the brass dragon uncoils and attempts to pick any lock within 10 feet of you. The dragon picks the lock using your proficiency bonus but with advantage. It is treated as having thieves’ tools when attempting to pick locks. It uses your Dexterity (Stealth) bonus for purposes of not being spotted but with advantage due to its extremely small size. Whether successful or not, once you have used the ring to attempt to pick a lock, it can’t be used again until the next sunset.

    <text>Aside from a minor difference in size, these simple golden hoops are identical to one another. Each hoop has 1 charge and provides a different magical effect. While wearing both hoops, you can use an action to expend a charge and cause one of the following effects:

	Small Hoop. Choose a 10 foot by 10 foot area you can see. For 10 minutes, you can hear all sounds as though you were standing within that area. You may end this effect at any time.
	
	Large Hoop. For 1 minute, while you are hidden, all creatures within a 10 foot by 10 foot area you can see receive disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks to see, hear, and smell you. If you become unhidden, this effect ends immediately.
	
	Each hoop regains 1 expended charge daily at dawn.

    <itemDetail>Weapon (javelin), uncommon</itemDetail>
    <text>The metallic head of this javelin is embellished with three small wings. When you speak a command word while making a ranged weapon attack with this magic weapon, a swirling vortex of wind follows its path through the air. Draw a line between you and the target of your attack; each creature within 10 feet of this line must make a DC 12 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is pushed backward 10 feet and falls prone.
	
Additionally, if this ranged weapon attack hits, the target must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target is pushed backward 15 feet and falls prone.

The javelin’s property can’t be used again until the next dawn. In the meantime, it can still be used as a magic weapon.

    <itemDetail>Armor (plate), rare (requires attunement)</itemDetail>
    <text>This plate armor was magically crafted from plates of interlocking stone. Tiny rubies inlaid in the chest create a glittering mosaic of flames. When you fall while wearing this armor, you can tuck your knees against your chest and curl into a ball. While falling in this way, flames form around your body.
	
	You take half the usual falling damage when you hit the ground, and fire explodes from your form in a 20-foot-radius sphere. Each creature in this area must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes fire damage equal to the falling damage you took, or half as much on a successful saving throw.
	
The fire spreads around corners and ignites flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried.

    <itemDetail>Weapon [any sword], rare (requires attunement)</itemDetail>
    <text>You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. The blade of the sword is coated in an endless supply of violet-colored slime. Despite the sword’s tendency to drip, the slime does not flow over the pommel, regardless of the angle at which it is held. You are entirely immune to the effect of the slime while attuned to this sword. You may communicate telepathically with ooze creatures while wielding this weapon, and you gain advantage on Charisma (Deception, Intimidation, and Persuasion) checks against oozes.
	
Once each combat, you may use an action to make a ranged attack (Dexterity modifier + Proficiency bonus to hit, range 20/40 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d8+2) poison damage) with the sword by flinging the slime towards any creature you can see. Creatures damaged by this attack must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of their next turn.

    <itemDetail>Staff, uncommon (requires attunement by a wizard)</itemDetail>
    <text>Crafted by a skilled wizard and meant to be a spellcaster’s last defense, this staff is 5 feet long, made of yew wood that curves at its top, is iron shod at its mid-section, and capped with a silver dragon’s claw that holds a lustrous, though rough and uneven, black pearl.
	
This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +1 to attack and damage rolls made with it. It has 4 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. Once daily, it can regain 1 expended charge by exposing the pearl to direct moonlight for 1 turn.

When used as a weapon, the staff howls and whistles hauntingly like the wind. When its spells are employed, the staff chirps like insects on a hot summer night.

**Spells.** While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: faerie fire (3 charges), gust of wind (1 charge).

When set on the ground, the spear always spins to point west.
	
When thrown in a westerly direction, the spear does an additional 2d6 cold damage to any creature it strikes.

    <text>While you are holding this heavy iron and wood torch, you may speak a command word and cause it to produce a magical, heatless, unending source of light that provides light identical to a mundane torch.

Any creature carrying a torch from a set may communicate telepathically up to five miles with any other creature carrying a torch from the same set as long as both torches are lit.

    <itemDetail>Weapon [any axe], very rare (requires attunement)</itemDetail>
    <text>This simple axe looks no different from a standard forester’s tool. A single-edged head is set into a slot in the haft and bound with strong cord. The axe was found by a timber-hauling crew who disappeared into the shadows of a cave deep in an old forest. Retrieved in the dark of the cave, the axe was found to possess disturbing magical properties. 
	
	You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon, which deals necrotic damage instead of slashing damage. When you hit a plant creature with it, the target must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take 4d6 extra damage and have its speed halved until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the target takes half of the extra damage and its speed is not halved. While you carry this axe, you may use an action to cast darkness (DC 14 to dispel, no concentration required). Once this property is used, it can’t be used again until the next sunset.
