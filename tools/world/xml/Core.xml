These bards use their knowledge and magic to uncover secrets and turn them against others through extortion and threats. </text>				<text>	Many other bards hate the College of Whispers, viewing it as a parasite that uses the bards&#8217; reputation to acquire wealth and power. For this reason, members of this college rarely reveal their true nature. They typically claim to follow some other college, or they keep their actual calling secret in order to infiltrate and exploit royal courts and other settings of power.</text>				<text>	</text>				<text>Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything, p. 16</text>			</feature>		</autolevel>

Clerics of these deities quest to search for objects lost to the forces of darkness, liberate mines overrun by orcs, and uncover rare and wondrous materials necessary to create potent magic items. Followers of these gods take great pride in their work, and they are willing to craft and use heavy armor and powerful weapons to protect them.

Their magic also allows them to stave off death for a time, particularly for a person who still has some great work to accomplish in the world.

		<autolevel level="1">			<feature>				<name>Spellcasting</name>				<text>Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the druid spell list. </text>				<text>	 </text>				<text>Cantrips:</text>				<text>	At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn an additional druid cantrip of your choice at 4th level and another at 10th level. </text>				<text>	 </text>				<text>Preparing and Casting Spells:</text>				<text>	The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell&#8217;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</text>				<text>	You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</text>				<text>	For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn&#8217;t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</text>				<text>	You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. </text>				<text>	 </text>				<text>Spellcasting Ability:</text>				<text>	Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</text>				<text>	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</text>				<text>	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier </text>				<text>	 </text>				<text>Ritual Casting:</text>				<text>	You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared. </text>				<text>	 </text>				<text>Spellcasting Focus:</text>				<text>	You can use a druidic focus (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.</text>				<text>	</text>				<text>Source: Player's Handbook, p. 66</text>			</feature>		</autolevel>

		<autolevel level="2">			<feature>				<name>Wild Shape</name>				<text>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</text>				<text>	Your druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table (Player&#8217;s Handbook, p. 66).</text>				<text>	At 2nd level, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn&#8217;t have a flying or swimming speed. At 4th level, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/2 or lower that doesn&#8217;t have a flying speed. At 8th level, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1 or lower.</text>				<text>	You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.</text>				<text>	While you are transformed, the following rules apply.</text>				<text>	 </text>				<text>&#8226; Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature&#8217;s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can&#8217;t use them.</text>				<text>	 </text>				<text>&#8226; When you transform, you assume the beast&#8217;s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn&#8217;t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren&#8217;t knocked unconscious.</text>				<text>	 </text>				<text>&#8226; You can&#8217;t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn&#8217;t break your concentration on a spell you&#8217;ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that you&#8217;ve already cast.</text>				<text>	 </text>				<text>&#8226; You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can&#8217;t use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.</text>				<text>	 </text>				<text>&#8226; You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature&#8217;s shape and size. Your equipment doesn&#8217;t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can&#8217;t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form. </text>				<text>	</text>				<text>Source: Player's Handbook, p. 66</text>			</feature>		</autolevel>

Their magic mends wounds and brings joy to downcast hearts, and the realms they protect are gleaming, fruitful places where dream and reality blend together and where the weary can find rest.</text>				<text>	</text>				<text>Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything, p. 22</text>			</feature>		</autolevel>

		<autolevel level="2">			<feature optional="YES">				<name>Druid Circle: Circle of the Shepherd</name>				<text>Druids of the Circle of the Shepherd commune with the spirits of nature, especially the spirits of beasts and the fey, and call to those spirits for aid. These druids recognize that all living things play a role in the natural world, yet they focus on protecting animals and fey creatures that have difficulty defending themselves. Shepherds, as they are known, see such creatures as their charges. They ward off monsters that threaten them, rebuke hunters who kill more prey than necessary, and prevent civilization from encroaching on rare animal habitats and on sites sacred to the fey. Many of these druids are happiest far from cities and towns, content to spend their days in the company of animals and the fey creatures of the wilds.</text>				<text>	Members of this circle become adventurers to oppose forces that threaten their charges or to seek knowledge and power that will help them safeguard their charges better.

This ability doesn&#8217;t grant you any special friendship with beasts, though you can combine this ability with gifts to curry favor with them as you would with any nonplayer character.</text>				<text>	</text>				<text>Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything, p. 23</text>			</feature>		</autolevel>

It counts as neither a creature nor an object, though it has the spectral appearance of the creature it represents.</text>				<text>	As a bonus action, you can move the spirit up to 60 feet to a point you can see.</text>				<text>	The spirit persists for 1 minute or until you&#8217;re incapacitated.

You and your allies gain advantage on all ability checks made to detect creatures in the spirit&#8217;s aura.

It isn&#8217;t enough for these paladins to establish order. They must crush the forces of chaos. Sometimes called knight tyrants or iron mongers, those who swear this oath gather into grim orders that serve gods or philosophies of war and well-ordered might.</text>				<text>	Some of these paladins go so far as to consort with the powers of the Nine Hells, valuing the rule of law over the balm of mercy. The archdevil Bel, warlord of Avernus, counts many of these paladins&#8212;called hell knights&#8212;as his most ardent supporters. Hell knights cover their armor with trophies taken from fallen enemies, a grim warning to any who dare oppose them and the decrees of their lords. These knights are often most fiercely resisted by other paladins of this oath, who believe that the hell knights have wandered too far into darkness.</text>				<text>	 </text>				<text>Tenets of Conquest: A paladin who takes this oath has the tenets of conquest seared on the upper arm.</text>				<text>	 </text>				<text>Douse the Flame of Hope: It is not enough to merely defeat an enemy in battle.

Sometimes called cavaliers, white knights, or holy warriors, these paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor, acting with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater good. They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some, for better or worse, hold the rest of the world to the same standards. Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their gods&#8217; tenets as the measure of their devotion.

		<autolevel level="3">			<feature optional="YES">				<name>Sacred Oath: Oath of Redemption</name>				<text>The Oath of Redemption sets a paladin on a difficult path, one that requires a holy warrior to use violence only as a last resort. Paladins who dedicate themselves to this oath believe that any person can be redeemed and that the path of benevolence and justice is one that anyone can walk. These paladins face evil creatures in the hope of turning their foes to the light, and they slay their enemies only when such a deed will clearly save other lives. Paladins who follow this path are known as redeemers.</text>				<text>	While redeemers are idealists, they are no fools. Redeemers know that undead, demons, devils, and other supernatural threats can be inherently evil. Against such foes, paladins who swear this oath bring the full wrath of their weapons and spells to bear. Yet the redeemers still pray that, one day, even creatures of wickedness will invite their own redemption.</text>				<text>	 </text>				<text>Tenets of Redemption:</text>				<text>	The tenets of the Oath of Redemption hold a paladin to a high standard of peace and justice.</text>				<text>	 </text>				<text>Peace: Violence is a weapon of last resort. Diplomacy and understanding are the paths to long-lasting peace.</text>				<text>	 </text>				<text>Innocence: All people begin life in an innocent state, and it is their environment or the influence of dark forces that drives them to evil. By setting the proper example, and working to heal the wounds of a deeply flawed world, you can set anyone on a righteous path.</text>				<text>	 </text>				<text>Patience: Change takes time. Those who have walked the path of the wicked must be given reminders to keep them honest and true. Once you have planted the seed of righteousness in a creature, you must work day after day to allow it to survive and then flourish.</text>				<text>	 </text>				<text>Wisdom: Your heart and mind must stay clear, for eventually you will be forced to admit defeat. While every creature can be redeemed, some are so far along the path of evil that you have no choice but to end their lives for the greater good. Any such action must be carefully weighed and the consequences fully understood, but once you have made the decision, follow through with it knowing your path is just.</text>				<text>	 </text>				<text>Redemption Spells:</text>				<text>	You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.</text>				<text>	 </text>				<text>3rd &#8212; sanctuary, sleep</text>				<text>	 </text>				<text>5th &#8212;calm emotions, hold person</text>				<text>	 </text>				<text>9th &#8212; counterspell, hypnotic pattern</text>				<text>	 </text>				<text>13th &#8212; Otiluke&#8217;s resilient sphere, stoneskin</text>				<text>	 </text>				<text>17th &#8212; hold monster, wall of force</text>				<text>	</text>				<text>Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything, p. 38</text>			</feature>		</autolevel>

Sometimes called fey knights, green knights, or horned knights, paladins who swear this oath cast their lot with the side of the light in the cosmic struggle against darkness because they love the beautiful and life-giving things of the world, not necessarily because they believe in principles of honor, courage, and justice.

The paladins who swear this oath dedicate themselves to serving society and, in particular, the laws that hold society together. These paladins are the watchful guardians on the walls, standing against the chaotic tides of barbarism that threaten to tear down all that civilization has built, and are commonly known as guardians, exemplars, or sentinels. Often, paladins who swear this oath are members of an order of knighthood in service to a nation or sovereign, and undergo their oath as part of their admission to the order&#8217;s ranks.</text>				<text>	 </text>				<text>Tenets of the Crown:</text>				<text>	The tenets of the Oath of the Crown are often set by the sovereign to which their oath is sworn, but generally emphasize the following tenets.</text>				<text>	 </text>				<text>Law: The law is paramount.

When evil forces slaughter helpless villagers, when an entire people turns against the will of the gods, when a thieves&#8217; guild grows too violent and powerful, when a dragon rampages through the countryside &#8212; at times like these, paladins arise and swear an Oath of Vengeance to set right that which has gone wrong.

You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</text>				<text>	For example, if you know the 1st-level spell animal friendship and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast animal friendship using either slot. </text>				<text>	 </text>				<text>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher:</text>				<text>	You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell list.</text>				<text>	You learn an additional ranger spell of your choice at each odd numbered level thereafter. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</text>				<text>	Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots. </text>				<text>	 </text>				<text>Spellcasting Ability:</text>				<text>	Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</text>				<text>	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</text>				<text>	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</text>				<text>	</text>				<text>Source: Player's Handbook, p. 91</text>			</feature>		</autolevel>

You can use your action to verbally command it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, Dodge, or Help action. Once you have the Extra Attack feature, you can make one weapon attack yourself when you command the beast to take the Attack action.</text>				<text>	If you are incapacitated or absent, the beast acts on its own, focusing on protecting you and itself.

In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</text>				<text>	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</text>				<text>	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your intelligence modifier </text>				<text>	 </text>				<text>Ritual Casting:</text>				<text>	You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don&#8217;t need to have the spell prepared. </text>				<text>	 </text>				<text>Spellcasting Focus:</text>				<text>	You can use an arcane focus (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells. </text>				<text>	 </text>				<text>Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher:</text>				<text>	Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook.</text>				<text>	</text>				<text>Source: Player's Handbook, p. 114</text>			</feature>		</autolevel>
		<autolevel level="1">			<feature>				<name>Spellbook</name>				<text>The spells of 1st level and higher that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard&#8217;s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</text>				<text>	 </text>				<text>Copying a Spell into the Book:</text>				<text>	When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</text>				<text>	Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</text>				<text>	For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</text>				<text>	 </text>				<text>Replacing the Book:</text>				<text>	You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book &#8212; for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</text>				<text>	If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</text>				<text>	 </text>				<text>The Book&#8217;s Appearance:</text>				<text>	Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</text>				<text>	</text>				<text>Source: Player's Handbook, p. 114</text>			</feature>		</autolevel>

War mages are also adept at turning other spellcasters&#8217; magical energy against them.</text>				<text>	In great battles, a war mage often works with evokers, abjurers, and other types of wizards.

<background>	<name>Faction Agent</name>	<proficiency>Insight</proficiency>	<trait>		<name>Description</name>		<text>Many organizations active in the North and across the face of Faer&#251;n aren't bound by strictures of geography. These factions pursue their agendas without regard for political boundaries, and their members operate anywhere the organization deems necessary. These groups employ listeners, rumormongers, smugglers, sellswords, cache-holders (people who guard caches of wealth or magic for use by the faction's operatives), haven keepers, and message drop minders, to name a few. At the core of every faction are those who don't merely fulfill a small function for that organization, but who serve as its hands, head, and heart. </text>		<text>	As a prelude to your adventuring career (and in preparation for it), you served as an agent of a particular faction in Faer&#251;n. You might have operated openly or secretly, depending on the faction and its goals, as well as how those goals mesh with your own.

Harper agents are often proficient in Investigation, enabling them to be adept at snooping and spying. They often seek aid from other Harpers, sympathetic bards and innkeepers, rangers, and the clergy of gods that are aligned with the Harpers' ideals. </text>		<text> </text>		<text>The Order of the Gauntlet: One of the newest power groups in Faer&#251;n, the Order of the Gauntlet has an agenda similar to that of the Harpers. Its methods are vastly different, however: bearers of the gauntlet are holy warriors on a righteous quest to crush evil and promote justice, and they never hide in the shadows. Order agents tend to be proficient in Religion, and frequently seek aid from law enforcement friendly to the order's ideals, and the clergy of the order's patron gods. </text>		<text> </text>		<text>The Emerald Enclave: Maintaining balance in the natural order and combating the forces that threaten that balance is the twofold goal of the Emerald Enclave. Those who serve the faction are masters of survival and living off the land. They are often proficient in Nature, and can seek assistance from woodsmen, hunters, rangers, barbarian tribes, druid circles, and priests who revere the gods of nature. </text>		<text> </text>		<text>The Lords' Alliance: On one level, the agents of the Lords' Alliance are representatives of the cities and other governments that constitute the alliance. But, as a faction with interests and concerns that transcend local politics and geography, the Alliance has its own cadre of individuals who work on behalf of the organizations, wider agenda. Alliance agents are required to be knowledgeable in History, and can always rely on the aid of the governments that are part of the Alliance, plus other leaders and groups who uphold the Alliance's ideals. </text>		<text> </text>		<text>The Zhentarim: In recent years, the Zhentarim have become more visible in the world at large, as the group works to improve its reputation among the common people. The faction draws employees and associates from many walks of life, setting them to tasks that serve the goals of the Black Network but aren't necessarily criminal in nature.

<background>	<name>Far Traveler</name>	<proficiency>Insight, Perception</proficiency>	<trait>		<name>Description</name>		<text>Almost all of the common people and other folk that one might encounter along the Sword Coast or in the North have one thing in common: they live out their lives without ever traveling more than a few miles from where they were born. </text>		<text>	You aren't one of those folk. </text>		<text>	You are from a distant place, one so remote that few of the common folk in the North realize that it exists, and chances are good that even if some people you meet have heard of your homeland, they know merely the name and perhaps a few outrageous stories. You have come to this part of Faer&#251;n for your own reasons, which you might or might not choose to share. </text>		<text>	Although you will undoubtedly find some of this land's ways to be strange and discomfiting, you can also be sure that some things its people take for granted will be to you new wonders that you've never laid eyes on before. By the same token, you're a person of interest, for good or ill, to those around you almost anywhere you go.</text>	</trait>	<trait>		<name>Why Are You Here?</name>		<text>A far traveler might have set out on a journey for one of a number of reasons, and the departure from his or her homeland could have been voluntary or involuntary. To determine why you are so far from home, roll 1d6 or choose from the options provided. The following section, discussing possible homelands, includes some suggested reasons that are appropriate for each location. </text>		<text> </text>		<text>1. Emissary </text>		<text>2. Exile </text>		<text>3. Fugitive </text>		<text>4. Pilgrim </text>		<text>5. Sightseer </text>		<text>6. Wanderer</text>	</trait>	<trait>		<name>Where Are You From?</name>		<text>The most important decision in creating a far traveler background is determining your homeland. The places discussed here are all sufficiently distant from the North and the Sword Coast to justify the use of this background. </text>		<text> </text>		<text>Evermeet: The fabled elven is lands far to the west are home to elves who have never been to Faer&#251;n. They often find it a harsher place than they expected when they do make the trip. If you are an elf, Evermeet is a logical (though not mandatory) choice for your homeland. </text>		<text> </text>		<text>Most of those who emigrate from Evermeet are either exiles, forced out for committing some infraction of elven law, or emissaries who come to Faer&#251;n for a purpose that benefits elven culture or society. </text>		<text> </text>		<text>Halruaa: Located on the southern edges of the Shining South, and hemmed in by mountains all around, the magocracy of Halruaa is a bizarre land to most in Faer&#251;n who know about it. Many folk have heard of the strange skyships the Halruaans sail, and a few know of the tales that even the least of their people can work magic. </text>		<text> </text>		<text>Halruaans usually make their journeys into Faer&#251;n for personal reasons, since their government has a strict stance against unauthorized involvement with other nations and organizations. You might have been exiled for breaking one of Halruaa's many byzantine laws, or you could be a pilgrim who seeks the shrines of the gods of magic. </text>		<text> </text>		<text>Kara-Tur: The continent of Kara-Tur, far to the east of Faen1n, is home to people whose customs are unfamiliar to the folk of the Sword Coast. If you come from Kara-Tur, the people of Faer&#251;n likely refer to you as Shou, even if that isn't your true ethnicity, because that's the blanket term they use for everyone who shares your origin. </text>		<text> </text>		<text>The folk of Kara-Tur occasionally travel to Faer&#251;n as diplomats or to forge trade relations with prosperous merchant cartels. You might have come here as part of some such delegation, then decided to stay when the mission was over. </text>		<text> </text>		<text>Mulhorand: From the terrain to the architecture to the god-kings who rule over these lands, nearly everything about Mulhorand is a lien to someone from the Sword Coast. You likely experienced the same sort of culture shock when you left your desert home and traveled to the unfamiliar climes of northern Faer&#251;n. Recent events in your homeland have led to the abolition of slavery, and a corresponding increase in the traffic between Mulhorand and the distant parts of Faer&#251;n. </text>		<text> </text>		<text>Those who leave behind Mulhorand's sweltering deserts and ancient pyramids for a glimpse at a different life do so for many reasons. You might be in the North simply to see the strangeness this wet land has to offer, or because you have made too many enemies among the desert communities of your home. </text>		<text> </text>		<text>Sossal: Few have heard of your homeland, but many have questions about it upon seeing you. Humans from Sossal seem crafted from snow, with alabaster skin and white hair, and typically dressed in white. </text>		<text> </text>		<text>Sossal exists far to the northeast, hard up against the endless ice to the north and bounded on its other sides by hundreds of miles of the Great Glacier and the Great Ice Sea. No one from your nation makes the effort to cross such colossal barriers without a convincing reason. You must fear something truly terrible or seek something incredibly important. </text>		<text> </text>		<text>Zakhara: As the saying goes among those in Faer&#251;n who know of the place, "To get to Zakhara, go south. Then go south some more." Of course, you followed an equally long route when you came north from your place of birth. Though it isn't unusual for Zakharans to visit the southern extremes of Faer&#251;n for trading purposes, few of them stray as far from home as you have. </text>		<text> </text>		<text>You might be traveling to discover what wonders are to be found outside the deserts and sword-like mountains of your homeland, or perhaps you are on a pilgrimage to understand the gods that others worship, so that you might better appreciate your own deities. </text>		<text> </text>		<text>The Underdark: Though your home is physically closer to the Sword Coast than the other locations discussed here, it is far more unnatural. You hail from one of the settlements in the Underdark, each of which has its own strange customs and laws. If you are a native of one of the great subterranean cities or settlements, you are probably a member of the race that occupies the place but you might also have grown up there after being captured and brought below when you were a child. </text>		<text> </text>		<text>If you are a true Underdark native, you might have come to the surface as an emissary of your people, or perhaps to escape accusations of criminal behavior (whether warranted or not). If you aren't a native, your reason for leaving "home" probably has something to do with getting away from a bad situation.</text>	</trait>	<trait>		<name>Starting Proficiencies</name>		<text>Your background grants you the following proficiencies.</text>		<text> </text>		<text>Skills: Insight, Perception</text>		<text> </text>		<text>Languages: any one of your choice</text>		<text> </text>		<text>Tools: any one musical instrument or gaming set of your choice, likely something native to your homeland</text>	</trait>	<trait>		<name>All Eyes on You</name>		<text>Your accent, mannerisms, figures of speech, and perhaps even your appearance all mark you as foreign.

<background>	<name>Knight of the Order</name>	<proficiency>Persuasion</proficiency>	<trait>		<name>Description</name>		<text>You belong to an order of knights who have sworn oaths to achieve a certain goal. The nature of this goal depends on the order you serve, but in your eyes it is without question a vital and honorable endeavor. Faer&#251;n has a wide variety of knightly orders, all of which have a similar outlook concerning their actions and responsibilities. Though the term "knight" conjures ideas of mounted, heavily armored warriors of noble blood, most knightly orders in Faer&#251;n don't restrict their membership to such individuals. The goals and philosophies of the order are more important than the gear and fighting style of its members, and so most of these orders aren't limited to fighting types, but are open to all sorts of folk who are willing to battle and die for the order's cause. </text>	</trait>	<trait>		<name>Knightly Orders of Faer&#251;n</name>		<text>Many who rightfully call themselves "knight" earn that title as part of an order in service to a deity, such as Kelemvor's Eternal Order or Mystra's Knights of the Mystic Fire. Other knightly orders serve a government, royal family, or are the elite military of a feudal state, such as the brutal Warlock Knights ofVaasa. Other knighthoods are secular and nongovernmental organizations of warriors who follow a particular philosophy, or consider themselves a kind of extended family, similar to an order of monks. Although there are organizations, such as the Knights of the Shield, that use the trappings of knighthood without necessarily being warriors, most folk of Faer&#251;n who hear the word "knight" think of a mounted warrior in armor beholden to a code. Below are a few knightly organizations. </text>		<text> </text>		<text>Knights of the Unicorn: The Knights of the Unicorn began as a fad of romantically minded sons and daughters of patriar families in Baldur's Gate. On a lark, they took the unicorn goddess Lurue as their mascot and went on various adventures for fun. The reality of the dangers they faced eventually sank in, as did Lurue's tenets. Over time the small group grew and spread, gaining a following in places as far as Cormyr. The Knights of the Unicorn are chivalric adventurers who follow romantic ideals: life is to be relished and lived with laughter, quests should be taken on a dare, impossible dreams should be pursued for the sheer wonder of their completion, and everyone should be praised for their strengths and comforted in their weaknesses. </text>		<text> </text>		<text>Knights of Myth Drannor: Long ago, the Knights of Myth Drannor were a famous adventuring band, and Dove Falcon hand, one of the famous Seven Sisters, was one of them. The band took its name to honor the great but fallen city, just as the new Knights of Myth Drannor do today. With the city once again in ruins, Dove Falconhand decided to reform the group with the primary goal of building alliances and friendship between the civilized races of the world and goodly people in order to combat evil. The Knights of Myth Drannor once again ride the roads of the Dalelands, and they've begun to spread to the lands beyond. Their members, each accepted by Dove herself, are above all valiant and honest. </text>		<text> </text>		<text>Knights of the Silver Chalice: The Knights of the Silver Chalice was formed by edict of the demigod Siamorphe in Waterdeep a century ago. Siamorphe's ethos is the nobility's right and responsibility to rule, and the demigod is incarnated as a different noble mortal in each generation. By the decree of the Siamorphe at that time, the Knights of the Silver Chalice took it upon themselves to put a proper heir on the throne of Tethyr and reestablish order in that kingdom. Since then they have grown to be the most popular knighthood in Tethyr, a nation that has hosted many knighthoods in fealty to the crown.</text>	</trait>	<trait>		<name>Suggested Characteristics</name>		<text>Use the tables for the soldier background in the Player's Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a knight of your order. </text>		<text> </text>		<text>Your bond almost always involves the order to which you belong (or at least key members of it), and it is highly unusual for a knight's ideal not to reflect the agenda, sentiment, or philosophy of one's order.</text>	</trait>	<trait>		<name>Starting Proficiencies</name>		<text>Your background grants you the following proficiencies.</text>		<text> </text>		<text>Skills: Persuasion, plus one from among Arcana, History, Nature, and Religion, as appropriate for your order</text>		<text> </text>		<text>Languages: any one of your choice</text>		<text> </text>		<text>Tools: your choice of a gaming set or a musical instrument</text>	</trait>	<trait>		<name>Knightly Regard</name>		<text>Your receive shelter and succor from members of your knightly order and those who are sympathetic to its aims.

You carry a noble title, and your family owns land, collects taxes, and wields significant political influence.

Or you could be an honest, hard-working landowner who cares deeply about the people who live and work on your land, keenly aware of your responsibility to them.</text>		<text>	Work with your DM to come up with an appropriate title and determine how much authority that title carries. A noble title doesn't stand on its own &#8212; it's connected to an entire family, and whatever title you hold, you will pass it down to your own children. Not only do you need to determine your noble title, but you should also work with the DM to describe your family and their influence on you. </text>		<text>	Is your family old and established, or was your title only recently bestowed? How much influence do they wield, and over what area? What kind of reputation does your family have among the other aristocrats of the region? How do the common people regard them? What's your position in the family? Are you the heir to the head of the family? Have you already inherited the title? How do you feel about that responsibility? Or are you so far down the line of inheritance that no one cares what you do, as long as you don't embarrass the family? How does the head of your family feel about your adventuring career? Are you in your family's good graces, or shunned by the rest of your family?</text>		<text>	Does your family have a coat of arms? An insignia you might wear on a signet ring?

Unlike some people who collect bounties, though, you aren't a savage who follows quarry into or through the wilderness. You're involved in a lucrative trade, in the place where you live, that routinely tests your skills and survival instincts. What's more, you aren't alone, as a bounty hunter in the wild would be: you routinely interact with both the criminal subculture and other bounty hunters, maintaining contacts in both areas to help you succeed. </text>		<text>	You might be a cunning thief-catcher, prowling the rooftops to catch one of the myriad burglars of the city. Perhaps you are someone who has your ear to the street, aware of the doings of thieves' guilds and street gangs. You might be a "velvet mask" bounty hunter, one who blends in with high society and noble circles in order to catch the criminals that prey on the rich, whether pickpockets or con artists. The community where you plied your trade might have been one of Faer&#251;n's great metropolises, such as Waterdeep or Baldur's Gate, or a less populous location, perhaps Luskan or Yartar &#8212; any place that's large enough to have a steady supply of potential quarries. </text>		<text>	As a member of an adventuring party, you might find it more difficult to pursue a personal agenda that doesn't fit with the group's objectives &#8212; but on the other hand, you can take down much more formidable targets with the help of your companions.</text>	</trait>	<trait>		<name>Suggested Characteristics</name>		<text>Use the tables for the criminal background in the Player's Handbook as the basis for your bounty hunter's traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a bounty hunter. </text>		<text> </text>		<text>For instance, your bond might involve other bounty hunters or the organizations or individuals that employ you.

Tradition and taboo have kept the Uthgardt strong while the kingdoms of others have collapsed into chaos and ruin.

Perhaps this is why Uthgar chose to raise up the totems among the people as living embodiments of his power. Perhaps they needed a reminder of who they were and from whence they came. The Chosen of Uthgar led bands back to the old ways, and most of your people abandoned the soft ways of civilization.</text>		<text>	You might have grown up in one of the tribes that had decided to settle down, and now that they have abandoned that path, you find yourself adrift.

	<spell>		<name>Antimagic Field</name>		<level>8</level>		<school>A</school>		<ritual>NO</ritual>		<time>1 action</time>		<range>Self (10-foot-radius sphere)</range>		<components>V, S M (a pinch of powdered iron or iron filings)</components>		<duration>Concentration, up to 1 hour</duration>		<classes>Cleric, Wizard</classes>		<text>A 10-foot-radius invisible sphere of antimagic surrounds you. This area is divorced from the magical energy that suffuses the multiverse. Within the sphere, spells can't be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and even magic items become mundane. Until the spell ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on you. </text>		<text>	Spells and other magical effects, except those created by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere and can't protrude into it. A slot expended to cast a suppressed spell is consumed. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn't function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration. </text>		<text>	Targeted Effects: Spells and other magical effects, such as magic missile and charm person, that target a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on that target. </text>		<text>	Areas of Magic: The area of another spell or magical effect, such as fireball, can't extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed. For example, the flames created by a wall of fire are suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough. </text>		<text>	Spells: Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it. </text>		<text>	Magic Items: The properties and powers of magic items are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a +1 long sword in the sphere functions as a nonmagical long sword. A magic weapon's properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a magic weapon or piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere (For example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic spear at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits. </text>		<text>	Magical Travel: Teleportation and planar travel fail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point for such magical travel. A portal to another location, world, or plane of existence, as well as an opening to an extradimensional space such as that created by the rope trick spells, temporarily closes while in the sphere. </text>		<text>	Creatures and Objects: A creature or object summoned or created by magic temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer within the sphere. </text>		<text>	Dispel Magic: Spells and magical effects such as dispel magic have no effect on the sphere. Likewise, the spheres created by different antimagic field spells don't nullify each other.</text>		<text />		<text>Source: Player's Handbook, p. 213</text>	</spell>

You target something within range, either a Huge or smaller object or creature or an area that is no larger than a 200-foot cube. Then specify a kind of intelligent creature, such as red dragons, goblins, or vampires. You invest the target with an aura that either attracts or repels the specified creatures for the duration. Choose antipathy or sympathy as the aura's effect.</text>		<text>	Antipathy: The enchantment causes creatures of the kind you designated to feel an intense urge to leave the area and avoid the target. When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened. The creature remains frightened while it can see the target or is within 60 feet of it. While frightened by the target, the creature must use its movement to move to the nearest safe spot from which it can't see the target. If the creature moves more than 60 feet from the target and can't see it, the creature is no longer frightened, but the creature becomes frightened again if it regains sight of the target or moves within 60 feet of it.</text>		<text>	Sympathy: The enchantment causes the specified creatures to feel an intense urge to approach the target while within 60 feet of it or able to see it. When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or use its movement on each of its turns to enter the area or move within reach of the target. When the creature has done so, it can't willingly move away from the target. If the target damages or otherwise harms an affected creature, the affected creature can make a Wisdom saving throw to end the effect, as described below.</text>		<text>	Ending the Effect: If an affected creature ends its turn while not within 60 feet of the target or able to see it, the creature makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is no longer affected by the target and recognizes the feeling of repugnance or attraction as magical. In addition, a creature affected by the spells is allowed another Wisdom saving throw every 24 hours while the spell persists.</text>		<text>	A creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to it for 1 minute, after which time it can be affected again.</text>		<text>	</text>		<text>Frightened:</text>		<text>&#8226; A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight.</text>		<text>	</text>		<text>&#8226; The creature can't willingly move closer to the source of its fear.</text>		<text />		<text>Source: Player's Handbook, p. 214</text>	</spell>

If the portal would open in the space occupied by a creature, the spell fails, and the casting is lost. </text>		<text>	The portals are two-dimensional glowing rings filled with mist, hovering inches from the ground and perpendicular to it at the points you choose. A ring is visible only from one side (your choice), which is the side that functions as a portal. </text>		<text>	Any creature or object entering the portal exits from the other portal as if the two were adjacent to each other, passing through a portal from the nonportal side has no effect.

You can choose from any of the following effects when you cast this spell. As an action on your turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one. </text>		<text>	Flood: You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land. If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave's path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing. The water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts. </text>		<text>	Part Water: You cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell's area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored. </text>		<text>	Redirect Flow: You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell's area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. </text>		<text>	Whirlpool: This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC. When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn't caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so. The first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage, this damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex. </text>		<text />		<text>Source: Player's Handbook, p. 227</text>	</spell>

When you cast the spell and as your action on each turn until the spell ends, you can focus your mind on any one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature you choose has an Intelligence of 3 or lower or doesn't speak any language, the creature is unaffected. </text>		<text>	You initially learn the surface thoughts of the creature &#8212; what is most on its mind in that moment. As an action, you can either shift your attention to another creature's thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the same creature's mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creatures thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check if it succeeds, the spell ends. </text>		<text>	Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective as part of an interrogation. </text>		<text>	You can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures you can't see. When you cast the spell or as your action during the duration, you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you. You can't detect a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower or one that doesn't speak any language. </text>		<text>	Once you detect the presence of a creature in this way, you can read its thoughts for the rest of the duration as described above, even if you can't see it, but it must still be within range.</text>		<text />		<text>Source: Player's Handbook, p. 231</text>	</spell>

You can fill any number of 5-foot squares on the ground that aren&#8217;t filled with fog with grasping weeds and vines, as if they were affected by an entangle spell.

You can animate up to four trees in the area, causing them to uproot themselves from the ground. These trees have the same statistics as an awakened tree, which appears in the Monster Manual, except they can&#8217;t speak, and their bark is covered with druidic symbols. If any creature not immune to this effect enters the warded area, the grove guardians fight until they have driven off or slain the intruders. The grove guardians also obey your spoken commands (no action required by you) that you issue while in the area. If you don&#8217;t give them commands and no intruders are present, the grove guardians do nothing. The grove guardians can&#8217;t leave the warded area.

You inscribe it either on a surface (such as a table or a section of floor or wall) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest) to conceal the glyph.The glyph can cover an area no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If the surface or object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered. </text>		<text>	The glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found. </text>		<text>	You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends. </text>		<text>	You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password. </text>		<text>	When you inscribe the glyph, choose explosive runes or a spell glyph. </text>		<text>	Explosive Runes: When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the glyph. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the aura must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage on a failed saving throw (your choice when you create the glyph), or half as much damage on a successful one. </text>		<text>	Spell Glyph: You can store a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the spell summons hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration. </text>		<text>	</text>		<text>At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage of an explosive runes glyph increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd. If you create a spell glyph, you can store any spell of up to the same level as the slot you use for the glyph of warding.</text>		<text />		<text>Source: Player's Handbook, p. 245</text>		<roll>5d8</roll>	</spell>

While affected by this spell, the creature doesn't need to breathe, eat, or drink, and it doesn't age. Divination spells can't locate or perceive the target. </text>		<text>	When you cast the spell, you choose one of the following forms of imprisonment. </text>		<text>	Burial: The target is entombed far beneath the earth in a sphere of magical force that is just large enough to contain the target. Nothing can pass through the sphere, nor can any creature teleport or use planar travel to get into or out of it. </text>		<text>	The special component for this version of the spell is a small mithral orb. </text>		<text>	Chaining: Heavy chains, firmly rooted in the ground, hold the target in place.

The condition can be as specific or as elaborate as you choose, but the DM must agree that the condition is reasonable and has a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature's name, identity, or deity but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities and not based on intangibles such as level, class, or hit points. </text>		<text>	A dispel magic spell can end the spell only if it is cast as a 9th-level spell, targeting either the prison or the special component used to create it. </text>		<text>	You can use a particular special component to create only one prison at a time.

If your check fails, the devil becomes immune to your verbal commands for the duration of the spell, though it can still carry out your commands if it chooses. If your check succeeds, the devil carries out your command &#8212; such as &#8220;attack my enemies,&#8221; &#8220;explore the room ahead,&#8221; or &#8220;bear this message to the queen&#8221; &#8212; until it completes the activity, at which point it returns to you to report having done so.</text>		<text>	 </text>		<text>	If your concentration ends before the spell reaches its full duration, the devil doesn&#8217;t disappear if it has become immune to your verbal commands.

The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, you create a phantasmal object, creature, or other visible phenomenon of your choice that is no larger than a 10-foot cube and that is perceivable only to the target for the duration. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs. </text>		<text>	The phantasm includes sound, temperature, and other stimuli, also evident only to the creature. </text>		<text>	The target can use its action to examine the phantasm with an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If the check succeeds, the target realizes that the phantasm is an illusion, and the spell ends. </text>		<text>	While a target is affected by the spell, the target treats the phantasm as if it were real. The target rationalizes any illogical outcomes from interacting with the phantasm. For example, a target attempting to walk across a phantasmal bridge that spans a chasm falls once it steps onto the bridge. If the target survives the fall, it still believes that the bridge exists and comes up with some other explanation for its fall&#8212;it was pushed, it slipped, or a strong wind might have knocked it off. </text>		<text>	An affected target is so convinced of the phantasm's reality that it can even take damage from the illusion. A phantasm created to appear as a creature can attack the target. Similarly, a phantasm created to appear as fire, a pool of acid, or lava can burn the target. Each round on your turn, the phantasm can deal 1d6 psychic damage to the target if it is in the phantasm's area or within 5 feet of the phantasm, provided that the illusion is of a creature or hazard that could logically deal damage, such as by attacking. The target perceives the damage as a type appropriate to the illusion.</text>		<text />		<text>Source: Player's Handbook, p. 264</text>		<roll>1d6</roll>	</spell>

The being must be known to you: a god, a primordial, a demon prince, or some other being of cosmic power.

If you know a specific creature's name, you can speak that name when you cast this spell to request that creature, though you might get a different creature anyway (DM's choice). </text>		<text>	When the creature appears, it is under no compulsion to behave in any particular way. You can ask the creature to perform a service in exchange for payment, but it isn't obliged to do so. The requested task could range from simple (fly us across the chasm, or help us fight a battle) to complex (spy on our enemies, or protect us during our foray into the dungeon). You must be able to communicate with the creature to bargain for its services. </text>		<text>	Payment can take a variety of forms. A celestial might require a sizable donation of gold or magic items to an allied temple, while a fiend might demand a living sacrifice or a gift of treasure. Some creatures might exchange their service for a quest undertaken by you. </text>		<text>	As a rule of thumb, a task that can be measured in minutes requires a payment worth 100 gp per minute. A task measured in hours requires 1,000 gp per hour. And a task m measured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10,000 gp per day. The DM can adjust these payments based on the circumstances under which you cast the spell. If the task is aligned with the creature's ethos, the payment might be halved or even waived. Nonhazardous tasks typically require only half the suggested payment, while especially dangerous tasks might require a greater gift. Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal. </text>		<text>	After the creature completes the task, or when the agreed-upon duration of service expires, the creature returns to its home plane after reporting back to you, if appropriate to the task and if possible. If you are unable to agree on a price for the creature's service, the creature immediately returns to its home plane. </text>		<text>	A creature enlisted to join your group counts as a member of it, receiving a full share of experience points awarded. </text>		<text />		<text>Source: Player's Handbook, p. 265</text>	</spell>

You give each target you choose a new, illusory appearance. An unwilling target can make a Charisma saving throw, and if it succeeds, it is unaffected by this spell. </text>		<text>	The spell disguises physical appearances as well as clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment. You can make each creature seem 1 foot shorter or taller and appear thin, fat, or in-between. You can't change a target's body type, so you must choose a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you. The spell lasts for the duration, unless you use your action to dismiss it sooner. </text>		<text>	The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspections. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to a creature's outfit objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel the creature's head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner then you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair. </text>		<text>	A creature can use its action to inspect a target and make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.

You can only speak if the creature can normally speak. </text>		<text>	When you transform, you choose whether your equipment falls to the ground, merges into the new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal. The DM determines whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change shape or size to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge into your new form. Equipment that merges has no effect in that state. </text>		<text>	During this spell's duration, you can use your action to assume a different form following the same restrictions and rules for the original form, with one exception: if your new form has more hit pints than your current one, your hit points remain at their current value.</text>		<text />		<text>Source: Player's Handbook, p. 274</text>	</spell>

If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place, if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered. </text>		<text>	The glyph is nearly invisible, requiring an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to find it. </text>		<text>	You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, approaching within a certain distance of it, or manipulating the object that holds it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers are opening the object, approaching within a certain distance of it, or seeing or reading the glyph. </text>		<text>	You can further refine the trigger so the spell is activated only under certain circumstances or according to a creature's physical characteristics (such as height or weight), or physical kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect hags or shapechangers). You can also specify creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password. </text>		<text>	When you inscribe the glyph, choose one of the options below for its effect. Once triggered, the glyph glows, filling a 60-foot-radius sphere with dim light for 10 minutes, after which time the spell ends. Each creature in the sphere when the glyph activates is targeted by its effect, as is a creature that enters the sphere for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. </text>		<text>	Death: Each target must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d 10 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful save. </text>		<text>	Discord: Each target must make a Constitution saving throw.

While frightened, the target drops whatever it is holding and must move at least 30 feet away from the glyph on each of its turns, if able. </text>		<text>	Hopelessness: Each target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target is overwhelmed with despair for 1 minute. During this time, it can't attack or target any creature with harmful abilities, spells, or other magical effects. </text>		<text>	Insanity; Each target must make an Intelligence saving throw.

If you target an object, it must be able to fit entirely inside a 10-foot cube, and it can't be held or carried by an unwilling creature. The destination you choose must be known to you, and it must be on the same plane of existence as you. Your familiarity with the destination determines whether you arrive there successfully.

"Associated object" means that you possess an object taken from the desired destination within the last six months, such as a book from a wizard's library, bed linen from a royal suite, or a chunk of marble from a lich's secret tomb.</text>		<text>	"Very familiar" is a place you have been very often, a place you have carefully studied, or a place you can see when you cast the spell. "Seen casually" is someplace you have seen more than once but with which you aren't very familiar. "Viewed once" is a place you have seen once, possibly using magic. "Description" is a place whose location and appearance you know through someone else's description, perhaps from a map. "False destination" is a place that doesn't exist. Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy's sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists.</text>		<text>	On Target: You and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to.</text>		<text>	Off Target: You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 x 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d 10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.</text>		<text>	Similar Area: You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.</text>		<text>	Mishap: The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).</text>		<text>	</text>		<text />		<text>Source: Player's Handbook, p. 281</text>	</spell>

The temple must fit within an unoccupied cube of space, up to 120 feet on each side. The temple remains until the spell ends. It is dedicated to whatever god, pantheon, or philosophy is represented by the holy symbol used in the casting.</text>		<text>	 </text>		<text>	You make all decisions about the temple&#8217;s appearance. The interior is enclosed by a floor, walls, and a roof, with one door granting access to the interior and as many windows as you wish. Only you and any creatures you designate when you cast the spell can open or close the door.</text>		<text>	 </text>		<text>	The temple&#8217;s interior is an open space with an idol or altar at one end. You decide whether the temple is illuminated and whether that illumination is bright light or dim light. The smell of burning incense fills the air within, and the temperature is mild.</text>		<text>	 </text>		<text>	The temple opposes types of creatures you choose when you cast this spell. Choose one or more of the following: celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, or undead. If a creature of the chosen type attempts to enter the temple, that creature must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it can&#8217;t enter the temple for 24 hours. Even if the creature can enter the temple, the magic there hinders it; whenever it makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw inside the temple, it must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from the d20 roll.</text>		<text>	 </text>		<text>	In addition, the sensors created by divination spells can&#8217;t appear inside the temple, and creatures within can&#8217;t be targeted by divination spells.</text>		<text>	 </text>		<text>	Finally, whenever any creature in the temple regains hit points from a spell of 1st level or higher, the creature regains additional hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1 hit point).</text>		<text>	 </text>		<text>	The temple is made from opaque magical force that extends into the Ethereal Plane, thus blocking ethereal travel into the temple&#8217;s interior. Nothing can physically pass through the temple&#8217;s exterior. It can&#8217;t be dispelled by dispel magic, and antimagic field has no effect on it. A disintegrate spell destroys the temple instantly.</text>		<text>	 </text>		<text>	Casting this spell on the same spot every day for a year makes this effect permanent.</text>		<text />		<text>Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything, p. 167</text>	</spell>

By simply speaking aloud, you can alter the very foundations of reality in accord with your desires. </text>		<text>	The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of or lower. You don't need to meet any requirements in that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect. Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice: </text>		<text>	&#8226; You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn't a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground. </text>		<text>	&#8226; You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them described in the greater restoration spell. </text>		<text>	&#8226; You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose. </text>		<text>	&#8226; You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to a lich's life drain attack. </text>		<text>	&#8226; You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a wish spell could undo an opponent's successful save, a foe's critical hit, or a friend's failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll. </text>		<text>	You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the DM as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance, the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item's current owner. </text>		<text>	The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a long rest, you take 1d10 necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn't 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast wish ever again if you suffer this stress.</text>		<text />		<text>Source: Player's Handbook, p. 288</text>	</spell>

The ice object can't have any moving parts, must be able to fit inside a 10-foot cube, and has the density and durability of metal or stone (Artus's choice). The ice creature must be modeled after a beast with a challenge rating of 2 or less. The ice creature has the same statistics as the beast it models, with the following changes: the creature is a construct with vulnerability to fire damage, immunity to cold and poison damage, and immunity to the following conditions: charmed, exhaustion, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, and poisoned. The ice creature obeys only its creator's commands. The ice object or creature appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of Artus. It melts into a pool of normal water after 24 hours or when it drops to 0 hit points. In extreme heat, it loses 5 (1d10) hit points per minute as it melts.

Such genies can innately cast the disguise self spell at will, often with a longer duration than is normal for that spell.

Such genies can change only their own shape, but a rare few can use the spell on other creatures and objects as well.</text>			<text>	Wishes.</text>			<text>	The genie power to grant wishes is legendary among mortals. Only the most potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A particular genie that has this power can grant one to three wishes to a creature that isn't a genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can't grant wishes again for some amount of time (usually 1 year). and cosmic law dictates that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that creature's existence.</text>			<text>	To be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the wish spell on the creature's behalf to bring about the effect. Depending on the genie's nature, the genie might try to pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting the wish's poor wording. The perversion of the wording is usually crafted to be to the genie's benefit.</text>		</trait>		<action>			<name>Multiattack</name>			<text>The Dao makes two fist attacks or two maul attacks.</text>		</action>		<action>			<name>Fist</name>			<text>Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

Paralyzing Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</text>			<text>	3. Fear Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</text>			<text>	4. Slowing Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target's speed is halved for 1 minute. In addition, the creature can't take reactions, and it can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</text>			<text>	5. Enervation Ray. The targeted creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</text>			<text>	6. Telekinetic Ray. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or the death tyrant moves it up to 30 ft. in any direction. It is restrained by the ray's telekinetic grip until the start of the death tyrant's next turn or until the death tyrant is incapacitated.</text>			<text>	If the target is an object weighing 300 pounds or less that isn't being worn or carried, it is moved up to 30 ft. in any direction. The death tyrant can also exert fine control on objects with this ray, such as manipulating a simple tool or opening a door or a container.</text>			<text>	7. Sleep Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or fall asleep and remain unconscious for 1 minute. The target awakens if it takes damage or another creature takes an action to wake it. This ray has no effect on constructs and undead.</text>			<text>	8. Petrification Ray. The targeted creature must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature begins to turn to stone and is restrained. It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified until freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.</text>			<text>	9. Disintegration Ray. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or take 45 (10d8) force damage. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, its body becomes a pile of fine gray dust.</text>			<text>	If the target is a Large or smaller nonmagical object or creation of magical force, it is disintegrated without a saving throw. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation of magical force, this ray disintegrates a 10-foot cube of it.</text>			<text>	10. Death Ray.

The genie can then cast the wish spell on the creature's behalf to bring about the effect. Depending on the genie's nature, the genie might try to pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting the wish's poor wording.

The wall can be damaged and breached; each 10-foot section has AC 5, 30 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. If a section is destroyed, it leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the space the wall occupied. Whenever a creature finishes moving through the frigid air on a turn, willingly or otherwise, the creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 17 (5d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Only the most potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A particular genie that has this power can grant one to three wishes to a creature that isn't a genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can't grant wishes again for some amount of time (usually 1 year). and cosmic law dictates that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that creature's existence.</text>			<text>	To be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the wish spell on the creature's behalf to bring about the effect. Depending on the genie's nature, the genie might try to pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting the wish's poor wording. The perversion of the wording is usually crafted to be to the genie's benefit.</text>		</trait>		<action>			<name>Multiattack</name>			<text>The marid makes two trident attacks.</text>		</action>		<action>			<name>Trident</name>			<text>Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target.

Armor reduced to an AC of 10 or a shield or magic item that drops to a 0 AC increase is destroyed.</text>			<attack>Destructive Claws|3|2d6+1</attack>		</action>		<spells></spells>		<slots></slots>	</monster>

On a successful save, the creature can't be infected by these spores for 24 hours. On a failed save, the creature is infected with a disease called the spores of Zuggtmoy and also gains a random form of madness (determined by rolling on the Madness of Zuggtmoy table) that lasts until the creature is cured of the disease or dies. While infected in this way, the creature can't be reinfected, and it must repeat the saving throw at the end of every 24 hours, ending the infection on a success. On a failure, the infected creature's body is slowly taken over by fungal growth, and after three such failed saves, the creature dies and is reanimated as a spore servant if it's a type of creature that can be (see the "Myconids" entry in the Monster Manual).</text>		</action>		<action>			<name>Mind Control Spores (Recharge 5-6)</name>			<text>Zuggtmoy releases spores that burst out in a cloud that fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on her, and it lingers for 1 minute.
