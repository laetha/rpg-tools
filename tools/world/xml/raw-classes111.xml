In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own. </text>				<text>	If the servant is killed, it can be returned to life via normal means, such as with the revivify spell. In addition, over the course of a long rest, you can repair a slain servant if you have access to its body. It returns to life with 1 hit point at the end of the rest.

For the duration, whenever any creature tries to attack you for the first time on a turn, the atatcker must make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, it can&#8217;t attack you on this turn, and it must choose a new target for its attack or the attack is wasted. On a successful save, it can attack you on this turn but it has disadvantage on any saving throw it makes against your spells on your next turn.</text>				<text>	Once you assume this majestic presence, you can&#8217;t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</text>				<text>	</text>									</lvl14skill>			</subclass>		<subclass>	<name>Lore</name>	<class>Bard</class>		<source>Source: Player's Handbook, p. 54</source>				<lvl03skill>							<name>Bard College: College of Lore</name>				<text>Bards of the College of Lore know something about most things, collecting bits of knowledge from sources as diverse as scholarly tomes and peasant tales. Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate compositions in royal courts, these bards use their gifts to hold audiences spellbound. When the applause dies down, the audience members might find themselves questioning everything they held to be true, from their faith in the priesthood of the local temple to their loyalty to the king.</text>				<text>	The loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit of beauty and truth, not in fealty to a monarch or following the tenets of a deity. A noble who keeps such a bard as a herald or advisor knows that the bard would rather be honest than politic.</text>				<text>	The college&#8217;s members gather in libraries and sometimes in actual colleges, complete with classrooms and dormitories, to share their lore with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-important figures of authority.</text>				<text>	</text>									</lvl03skill>		<lvl03skill>							<name>Cutting Words (College of Lore)</name>				<text>Also at 3rd level, you learn how to use your wit to distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and competence of others. When a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a damage roll, you can use your reaction to expend one of your uses of Bardic Inspiration, rolling a Bardic Inspiration die and subtracting the number rolled from the creature&#8217;s roll. You can choose to use this feature after the creature makes its roll, but before the DM determines whether the attack roll or ability check succeeds or fails, or before the creature deals its damage. The creature is immune if it can&#8217;t hear you or if it&#8217;s immune to being charmed.</text>				<text>	</text>									</lvl03skill>		<lvl03skill>							<name>Bonus Proficiencies (College of Lore)</name>				<text>When you join the College of Lore at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with three skills of your choice.</text>				<text>	</text>									</lvl03skill>						<lvl06skill>							<name>Additional Magical Secrets (College of Lore)</name>				<text>At 6th level, you learn two spells of your choice from any class.

Blades perform stunts such as sword swallowing, knife throwing and juggling, and mock combats. But though they use their weapons to entertain, they are also highly trained and skilled warriors in their own right.</text>				<text>	Their talent with weapons inspires many blades to lead double lives. One blade might use a circus troupe as cover for nefarious deeds such as assassination, robbery, and blackmail. Other blades strike at the wicked, bringing justice to bear against the cruel and powerful. Most troupes are happy to accept a blade&#8217;s talent for the excitement it adds to a performance, but few entertainers fully trust a blade in their ranks.</text>				<text>	Blades who abandon lives as entertainers have often run into trouble that makes maintaining their secret activities impossible. A blade caught stealing or engaging in vigilante justice is too great a liability for most troupes. With their weapon skills and magic, these blades either take up work as enforcers for thieves&#8217; guilds or strike out on their own as adventurers.</text>				<text>	</text>									</lvl03skill>		<lvl03skill>							<name>Bonus Proficiencies (College of Swords)</name>				<text>When you join the College of Swords at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with medium armor and the scimitar.</text>				<text>	If you&#8217;re proficient with a simple or martial melee weaponn, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells.</text>				<text>	</text>									</lvl03skill>		<lvl03skill>							<name>Fighting Style (College of Swords)</name>				<text>At 3rd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty.

These bards gather in mead halls or around great bonfires to sing the deeds of the mighty, both past and present.

Bards of the College of Whispers use this to their advantage. They appear to be like any other bard, sharing news, singing songs, and telling tales to the audiences they gather. In truth, the College of Whispers teaches its students that they are wolves among sheep. These bards use their knowledge and magic to uncover secrets and turn them against others through extortion and threats. </text>				<text>	Many other bards hate the College of Whispers, viewing it as a parasite that uses the bards&#8217; reputation to acquire wealth and power. For this reason, members of this college rarely reveal their true nature. They typically claim to follow some other college, or they keep their actual calling secret in order to infiltrate and exploit royal courts and other settings of power.</text>				<text>	</text>									</lvl03skill>		<lvl03skill>							<name>Psychic Blades (College of Whispers)</name>				<text>When you join the College of Whispers at 3rd level, you gain the ability to magically make your weapon attacks toxic to a creature&#8217;s mind. </text>				<text>	When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to deal an additional 2d6 psychic damage to that target.
