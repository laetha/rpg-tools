    <lvl01skill2name>Magic Item Analysis</lvl01skill2name>
    <lvl01skill2text>Starting at 1st level, your understanding of magic items allows you to analyze and understand their secrets. You know the artificer spells detect magic and identify, and you can cast them as rituals. You don’t need to provide a material component when casting identify with this class feature. 
</lvl01skill2text>
    <lvl01skill3name>Artificer Specialist</lvl01skill3name>
    <lvl01skill3text>At 1st level, you choose the type of Artificer Specialist you are: Alchemist or Gunsmith, both of which are detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 1st level and again at 3rd, 9th, 14th, and 17th level.  
</lvl01skill3text>
    <lvl02skill1name>Tool Expertise</lvl02skill1name>
    <lvl02skill1text>Starting at 2nd level, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses any of the tool proficiencies you gain from this class. 
</lvl02skill1text>
    <lvl02skill2name>Wondrous Invention</lvl02skill2name>
    <lvl02skill2text>At 2nd level, you gain the use of a magic item that you have crafted. Choose the item from the list of 2nd-level items below.  
	Crafting an item is a difficult task. When you gain a magic item from this feature, it reflects long hours of study, tinkering, and experimentation that allowed you to finally complete the item. You are assumed to work on this item in your leisure time and to finish it when you level up.  
	You complete another item of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class: 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th level. The item you choose must be on the list for your current artificer level or a lower level.  
	These magic items are detailed in the Dungeon Master’s Guide.  
 
2nd Level: bag of holding, cap of water breathing, driftglobe, goggles of night, sending stones 
</lvl02skill2text>
    <lvl03skill1name>Spellcasting</lvl03skill1name>
    <lvl03skill1text>As part of your study of magic, you gain the ability to cast spells at 3rd level. The spells you learn are limited in scope, primarily concerned with modifying creatures and objects or creating items.  
 
Spell Slots:  
	The Artificer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.  
 
Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher:  
	You know three 1st-level spells of your choice from the artificer spell list (which appears at the end of this document).  
	The Spells Known column of the Artificer table shows when you learn more artificer spells of your choice from this feature. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots on the Artificer table. 
	You learn an additional spell at 4th, 7th, 8th, 10th, 11th, 13th, 14th, 16th, 19th, and 20th level.  
	Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the artificer spells you know from this feature and replace it with another spell from the artificer spell list. The new spell must also be of a level for which you have spell slots on the Artificer table.  
 
Spellcasting Ability:  
	Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your artificer spells; your understanding of the theory behind magic allows you to wield these spells with superior skill. You use your Intelligence whenever an artificer spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an artificer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.  
 
Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier  
 
Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier 
 
Spellcasting Focus:  
	You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your artificer spells. See chapter 5, “Equipment,” in the Player’s Handbook for various arcane focus options.  
</lvl03skill1text>
    <lvl04skill1name>Ability Score Improvement</lvl04skill1name>
    <lvl04skill1text>When you reach 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 18th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. 
</lvl04skill1text>
    <lvl04skill2name>Infuse Magic</lvl04skill2name>
    <lvl04skill2text>Starting at 4th level, you gain the ability to channel your artificer spells into objects for later use. When you cast an artificer spell with a casting time of 1 action, you can increase its casting time to 1 minute. If you do so and hold a nonmagical item throughout the casting, you expend a spell slot, but none of the spell’s effects occur. Instead, the spell transfers into that item for later use if the item doesn’t already contain a spell from this feature.  
	Any creature holding the item thereafter can use an action to activate the spell if the creature has an Intelligence score of at least 6. The spell is cast using your spellcasting ability, targeting the creature that activates the item. If the spell targets more than one creature, the creature that activates the item selects the additional targets. If the spell has an area of effect, it is centered on the item. If the spell’s range is self, it targets the creature that activates the item.  
	When you infuse a spell in this way, it must be used within 8 hours. After that time, its magic fades and is wasted.  
	You can have a limited number of infused spells at the same time. The number equals your Intelligence modifier. 
</lvl04skill2text>
    <lvl05skill1name>Wondrous Invention (2nd)</lvl05skill1name>
    <lvl05skill1text>You complete another magic item of your choice. The item you choose must be on the list for your current artificer level or a lower level.  
	These magic items are detailed in the Dungeon Master’s Guide.  
 
2nd Level: bag of holding, cap of water breathing, driftglobe, goggles of night, sending stones  
 
5th Level: alchemy jug, helm of comprehending languages, lantern of revealing, ring of swimming, robe of useful items, rope of climbing, wand of magic detection, wand of secrets 
</lvl05skill1text>
    <lvl05skill2name>Superior Attunement (Four Items)</lvl05skill2name>
    <lvl05skill2text>At 5th level, your superior understanding of magic items allows you to master their use. You can now attune to up to four, rather than three, magic items at a time. At 15th level, this limit increases to five magic items. 
</lvl05skill2text>
    <lvl06skill1name>Mechanical Servant</lvl06skill1name>
    <lvl06skill1text>At 6th level, your research and mastery of your craft allow you to produce a mechanical servant. The servant is a construct that obeys your commands without hesitation and functions in combat to protect you. Though magic fuels its creation, the servant is not magical itself. You are assumed to have been working on the servant for quite some time, finally finishing it during a short or long rest after you reach 6th level.  
	Select a Large beast with a challenge rating of 2 or less. The servant uses that beast’s game statistics, but it can look however you like, as long as its form is appropriate for its statistics. It has the following modifications:  
 
• It is a construct instead of a beast.  
 
• It can’t be charmed.  
 
• It is immune to poison damage and the poisoned condition.  
 
• It gains darkvision with a range of 60 feet if it doesn’t have it already.  
 
• It understands the languages you can speak when you create it, but it can’t speak.  
 
• If you are the target of a melee attack and the servant is within 5 feet of the attacker, you can use your reaction to command the servant to respond, using its reaction to make a melee attack against the attacker.  
	The servant obeys your orders to the best of its ability. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own.  
	If the servant is killed, it can be returned to life via normal means, such as with the revivify spell. In addition, over the course of a long rest, you can repair a slain servant if you have access to its body. It returns to life with 1 hit point at the end of the rest. If the servant is beyond recovery, you can build a new one with one week of work (eight hours each day) and 1,000 gp of raw materials.

    <lvl01skill1name>Artificer Specialist: Alchemist</lvl01skill1name>
    <lvl01skill1text>An alchemist is an expert at combining exotic reagents to produce a variety of materials, from healing draughts that can mend a wound in moments to clinging goo that slows creatures down.  
</lvl01skill1text>
    <lvl01skill2name>Alchemist's Satchel (Alchemist)</lvl01skill2name>
    <lvl01skill2text>At 1st level, you craft an Alchemist’s Satchel, a bag of reagents that you use to create a variety of concoctions. The bag and its contents are both magical, and this magic allows you to pull out exactly the right materials you need for your Alchemical Formula options, described below. After you use one of those options, the bag reclaims the materials.  
	If you lose this satchel, you can create a new one over the course of three days of work (eight hours each day) by expending 100 gp worth of leather, glass, and other raw materials. 
</lvl01skill2text>
    <lvl01skill3name>Alchemical Formula (3) (Alchemist)</lvl01skill3name>
    <lvl01skill3text>At 1st level, you learn three Alchemical Formula options: Alchemical Fire, Alchemical Acid, and one other option of your choice. You learn an additional formula of your choice at 3rd, 9th, 14th, and 17th levels.  
	To use any of these options, your Alchemist’s Satchel must be within reach.  
	If an Alchemical Formula option requires a saving throw, the DC is 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier. 
</lvl01skill3text>
    <lvl01skill4name>Alchemical Formula: Alchemical Fire</lvl01skill4name>
    <lvl01skill4text>As an action, you can reach into your Alchemist’s Satchel, pull out a vial of volatile liquid, and hurl the vial at a creature, object, or surface within 30 feet of you (the vial and its contents disappear if you don’t hurl the vial by the end of the current turn). On impact, the vial detonates in a 5-foot radius. Any creature in that area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 fire damage.  
	This formula’s damage increases by 1d6 when you reach certain levels in this class: 4th level (2d6), 7th level (3d6), 10th level (4d6), 13th level (5d6), 16th level (6d6), and 19th level (7d6). 
</lvl01skill4text>
    <lvl01skill5name>Alchemical Formula: Alchemical Acid</lvl01skill5name>
    <lvl01skill5text>As an action, you can reach into your Alchemist’s Satchel, pull out a vial of acid, and hurl the vial at a creature or object within 30 feet of you (the vial and its contents disappear if you don’t hurl the vial by the end of the current turn). The vial shatters on impact. A creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 acid damage. An object automatically takes that damage, and the damage is maximized.  
	This formula’s damage increases by 1d6 when you reach certain levels in this class: 3rd level (2d6), 5th level (3d6), 7th level (4d6), 9th level (5d6), 11th level (6d6), 13th level (7d6), 15th level (8d6), 17th level (9d6), and 19th level (10d6). 
</lvl01skill5text>
    <lvl01skill6name>Alchemical Formula: Healing Draught</lvl01skill6name>
    <lvl01skill6text>As an action, you can reach into your Alchemist’s Satchel and pull out a vial of healing liquid. A creature can drink it as an action to regain 1d8 hit points. The vial then disappears. Once a creature regains hit points from this alchemical formula, the creature can’t do so again until it finishes a long rest. If not used, the vial and its contents disappear after 1 hour. While the vial exists, you can’t use this formula.  
	This formula’s healing increases by 1d8 when you reach certain levels in this class: 3rd level (2d8), 5th level (3d8), 7th level (4d8), 9th level (5d8), 11th level (6d8), 13th level (7d8), 15th level (8d8), 17th level (9d8), and 19th level (10d8). 
</lvl01skill6text>
    <lvl01skill7name>Alchemical Formula: Smoke Stick</lvl01skill7name>
    <lvl01skill7text>As an action, you can reach into your Alchemist’s Satchel and pull out a stick that produces a thick plume of smoke. You can hold on to the stick or throw it to a point up to 30 feet away as part of the action used to produce it. The area in a 10-foot radius around the stick is filled with thick smoke that blocks vision, including darkvision. The stick and smoke persist for 1 minute and then disappear. After using this formula, you can’t do so again for 1 minute. 
</lvl01skill7text>
    <lvl01skill8name>Alchemical Formula: Swift Step Draught</lvl01skill8name>
    <lvl01skill8text>As a bonus action, you can reach into your Alchemist’s Satchel and pull out a vial filled with a bubbling, brown liquid. As an action, a creature can drink it. Doing so increases the creature’s speed by 20 feet for 1 minute, and the vial disappears. If not used, the vial and its contents disappear after 1 minute. After using this formula, you can’t do so again for 1 minute. 
</lvl01skill8text>
    <lvl01skill9name>Alchemical Formula: Tanglefoot Bag </lvl01skill9name>
    <lvl01skill9text>As an action, you can reach into your Alchemist’s Satchel and pull out a bag filled with writhing, sticky black tar and hurl it at a point on the ground within 30 feet of you (the bag and its contents disappear if you don’t hurl the bag by the end of the current turn). The bag bursts on impact and covers the ground in a 5-foot radius with sticky goo. That area becomes difficult terrain for 1 minute, and any creature that starts its turn on the ground in that area has its speed halved for that turn. After using this formula, you can’t do so again for 1 minute. 
</lvl01skill9text>
    <lvl01skill10name>Alchemical Formula: Thunderstone</lvl01skill10name>
    <lvl01skill10text>As an action, you can reach into your Alchemist’s Satchel and pull out a crystalline shard and hurl it at a creature, object, or surface within 30 feet of you (the shard disappears if you don’t hurl it by the end of the current turn). The shard shatters on impact with a blast of concussive energy. Each creature within 10 feet of the point of impact must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be knocked prone and pushed 10 feet away from that point.

    <lvl09skill1text>Starting at 9th level, you can channel force energy into your Thunder Cannon. As an action, you can make a special attack with it. Rather than making an attack roll, you unleash force energy in a 15-foot cone from the gun. Each creature in that area must make a Strength saving throw with a DC of 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.

    <lvl01skill2name>Rage</lvl01skill2name>
    <lvl01skill2text>In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action. 
	While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren’t wearing heavy armor. 
 
• You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. 
 
• When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a barbarian. At 1st level, you have a +2 bonus to damage. Your bonus increases to +3 at 9th level and to +4 at 16th. 
 
• You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. 
 
	If you are able to cast spells, you can’t cast them or concentrate on them while raging. 
	Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven’t attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action. 
	Once you have raged the maximum number of times for your barbarian level, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again. You may rage 2 times at 1st level, 3 at 3rd, 4 at 6th, 5 at 12th, and 6 at 17th.

</lvl02skill1text>
    <lvl02skill2name>Danger Sense</lvl02skill2name>
    <lvl02skill2text>At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren’t as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger.

    <lvl03skill1name>Primal Path: Path of the Ancestral Guardian</lvl03skill1name>
    <lvl03skill1text>Some barbarians hail from cultures that revere their ancestors. These tribes teach that the warriors of the past linger on in the world as mighty spirits, who can guide and protect the living. When barbarians who follow this path rage, they cross the barrier into the spirit world and call on these guardian spirits for aid. 
	Barbarians who draw on their ancestral guardians fight to protect their tribes and their allies. With the spirits’ help, they can hinder their foes even as they strike powerful blows against them. In order to cement ties to their ancestral guardians, barbarians who follow this path cover themselves in elaborate tattoos that celebrate their ancestors’ deeds. These tattoos tell epic sagas of victories against terrible monsters and other fearsome rivals.

    <lvl03skill2text>Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, spectral warriors appear when you enter your rage. While you’re raging, the first creature you hit with an attack on your turn becomes the target of the warriors, which hinder its attacks. Until the start of your next turn, that target has disadvantage on any attack roll that isn’t against you, and when the target hits a creature other than you with an attack, that creature has resistance to the damage dealt by the attack. The ffect on the target ends early if your rage ends.

Rather than creating a spherical sensor, this use of clairvoyance invisibly summons one of your ancestral spirits to the chosen location. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells. 
	After you cast either spell in this way, you can’t use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.

    <lvl03skill1text>For some barbarians, rage is a means to an end — that end being violence. The Path of the Berserker is a path of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter the berserker’s rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well-being.

If you do so, for the duration of your rage you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns after this one. When your rage ends, you suffer one level of exhaustion. 
 
Exhaustion: 
	Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect's description. 
 
Level — Effect: 
1 —Disadvantage on ability checks 
2 —Speed halved 
3 —Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws 
4 —Hit point maximum halved 
5 —Speed reduced to 0 
6 —Death 
 
	If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect's description. 
	A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks. 
	An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect's description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature's exhaustion level is reduced below 1. 
	Finishing a long rest reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink.

	If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you can’t use this feature on that creature again for 24 hours.

    <lvl03skill1text>All barbarians harbor a fury within. Their rage grants them superior strength, durability, and speed. Barbarians who follow the Path of the Storm Herald learn to transform their rage into a mantle of primal magic, which swirls around them. When in a fury, a barbarian of this path taps into the forces of nature to create powerful magical effects. 
	Storm heralds are typically elite champions who train alongside druids, rangers, and others sworn to protect nature. Other storm heralds hone their craft in elite lodges in regions wracked by storms, in the frozen reaches at the world’s end, or deep in the hottest deserts.

    <lvl03skill2text>Starting at 3rd level, you emanate a stormy magical aura while you rage. The aura extends 10 feet from you in every direction, but not through total cover. 
	 Your aura has an effect that activates when you enter your rage, and you can activate the effect again on each of your turns as a bonus action. Choose desert, sea, or tundra. Your aura’s effect depends on that chosen environment, as detailed below. You can change your environment choice whatever you gain a level in this class. 
	 if your aura’s effects require a saving throw, the DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier. 
 
Desert: When this affect is activated, all other creatures your aura take 2 fire damage each. The damage increases when you reach certain levels in his class, increasing to 3 at 5th level, 4 at 10th level, 5 at 15th level, and 6 at 20th level. 
 
Sea: When this effect is activated, you can choose one other creature you can see in your aura. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. The target takes 1d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 2d6 at 10th level, 3d6 at 15th level, and 4d6 at 20th level. 
 
Tundra: When this effect is activated, each creature of your choice in your aura gains 2 temporary hit points, as icy spirits try to inure it to suffering.

Sea: When you hit a creature in your aura with an attack, you can use your reaction to force that creature to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone, as if struck by a wave. 
 
Tundra: Whenever the effect of your Storm Aura is activated, you can choose one creature you can see in the aura. That creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw, or its speed is reduced to 0 until the start of your next turnm as magical frost covers it. 
 
Prone: 
• A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition. 
 
• The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls. 
 
• An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.

For example, if you have a bear totem spirit, you might be unusually hairy and thick-skinned, or if your totem is the eagle, your eyes turn bright yellow.

    <lvl10skill1text>At 10th level, you can cast the commune with nature spell, but only as a ritual. When you do so, a spiritual version of one of the animals you chose for Totem Spirit or Aspect of the Beast appears to you to convey the information you seek.

    <lvl14skill2text>While you’re raging, any creature within 5 feet of you that’s hostile to you has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you or another character with this feature. An enemy is immune to this effect if it can’t see or hear you or if it can’t be frightened.

    <lvl14skill3name>Totemic Attunement: Eagle</lvl14skill3name>

    <lvl14skill4text>While raging, you can use a bonus action during your move to pass through the space of a Large or smaller creature.

• The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls. 
 
• An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.

    <lvl03skill1name>Primal Path: Path of the Zealot</lvl03skill1name>
    <lvl03skill1text>Some deities inspire their followers to pitch themselves into a ferocious battle fury. These barbarians are zealots—warriors who channel their rage into powerful displays of divine power. 
	A variety of gods across the worlds of D&amp;D inspire their followers to embrace this path. Tempus from the Forgotten Realms and Hextor and Erythnul of Greyhawk are all prime examples. In general, the gods who inspire zealots are deities of combat, destruction, and violence. Not all are evil, but few are good. 
</lvl03skill1text>
    <lvl03skill2name>Divine Fury (Path of the Zealot)</lvl03skill2name>
    <lvl03skill2text>Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can channel divine fury into your weapon strikes. While you’re raging, the first creature you hit on each of your turns with a weapon attack takes extra damage equal to 1d6 + half your barbarian level. The extra damage is necrotic or radiant; you choose the type of damage when you gain this feature. 
</lvl03skill2text>
    <lvl03skill3name>Warrior of the Gods (Path of the Zealot)</lvl03skill3name>
    <lvl03skill3text>At 3rd level, your soul is marked for endless battle. If a spell, such as raise dead, has the sole effect of restoring you to life (but not undeath), the caster doesn’t need material components to cast the spell on you.

    <lvl06skill1name>Fanatical Focus (Path of the Zealot)</lvl06skill1name>
    <lvl06skill1text>Starting at 6th level, the divine power that fuels your rage can protect you. If you fail a saving throw while you’re raging, you can reroll it, and you must use the new roll. You can use this ability only once per rage.

	Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

    <lvl14skill1text>Beginning at 14th level, the divine power that fuels your rage allows you to shrug off fatal blows. 
	While you’re raging, having 0 hit points doesn’t knock you unconscious. You still must make death saving throws, and you suffer the normal effects of taking damage while at 0 hit points. However, if you would die due to failing death saving throws, you don’t die until your rage ends, and you die then only if you still have 0 hit points..

    <lvl01skill2name>Spellcasting</lvl01skill2name>
    <lvl01skill2text>You have learned to untangle and reshape the fabric of reality in harmony with your wishes and music. Your spells are part of your vast repertoire, magic that you can tune to different situations. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the bard spell list. 
 
Cantrips: 
	You know two cantrips of your choice from the bard spell list. You learn additional bard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, learning a 3rd cantrip at 4th level and a 4th at 10th level. 
 
Spell Slots: 
	The Bard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. 
	For example, if you know the 1st-level spell cure wounds and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast cure wounds using either slot. 
 
Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher: 
	You know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the bard spell list. 
	You learn an additional bard spell of your choice at each level except 12th, 16th, 19th, and 20th. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level. 
	Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the bard spells you know and replace it with another spell from the bard spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots. 
 
Spellcasting Ability: 
	Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard spells. Your magic comes from the heart and soul you pour into the performance of your music or oration. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a bard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. 
	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier 
	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier 
 
Ritual Casting: 
	You can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag. 
 
Spellcasting Focus: 
	You can use a musical instrument (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells. 
</lvl01skill2text>
    <lvl01skill3name>Bardic Inspiration</lvl01skill3name>
    <lvl01skill3text>You can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d6. 
	Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time. 
	You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest. 
	Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level.

    <lvl02skill2name>Song of Rest</lvl02skill2name>
    <lvl02skill2text>Beginning at 2nd level, you can use soothing music or oration to help revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest. If you or any friendly creatures who can hear your performance regain hit points at the end of the short rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points. 
	The extra hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level. 
</lvl02skill2text>

    <lvl03skill1text>The College of Glamour is the home of bards who mastered their craft in the vibrant realm of the Feywild or under the tutelage of someone who dwelled there. Tutored by satyrs, eladrin, and other fey, these bards learn to use their magic to delight and captivate others.  
	The bards of this college are regarded with a mixture of awe and fear. Their performances are the stuff of legend. The bards of this college are so eloquent that a speech or song that one of them performs can cause captors to release the bard unharmed and can lull a furious dragon into complacency. The same magic that allows them to quell beasts can also bend minds. Villainous bards of this college can leech off a community for weeks, abusing their magic to turn their hosts into thralls. Heroic bards of this college instead use this power to gladden the downtrodden and undermine oppressors. 
</lvl03skill1text>
    <lvl03skill2name>Mantle of Inspiration (College of Glamour)</lvl03skill2name>
    <lvl03skill2text>When you join the College of Glamour at 3rd level, you gain the ability to weave a song of fey magic that imbues your allies with vigor and speed.  
	As a bonus action, you can expend a use of Bardic Inspiration to grant yourself a wondrous appearance. When you do so, choose a number of allies you can see and who can see you within 60 feet of you, up to a number equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). Each of them gains 5 temporary hit points. When a creature gains these temporary hit points, it can immediately use its reaction to move up to its speed, without provoking opportunity attacks. 
	The number of temporary hit points increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 8 at 5th level, 11 at 10th level, and 14 at 15th level. 
</lvl03skill2text>
    <lvl03skill3name>Enthralling Performance (College of Glamour)</lvl03skill3name>
    <lvl03skill3text>Starting at 3rd level, you can charge your performance with seductive, fey magic.  
	If you perform for at least 1 minute, you can attempt to inspire wonder in your audience by singing, reciting a poem, or dancing. At the end of the performance, choose a number of humanoids within 60 feet of you who watched and listened to all of it, up to a number equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be charmed by you. While charmed in this way, the target idolizes you, it speaks glowingly of you to anyone who talks to it, and it hinders anyone who opposes you, although it avoids violence unless it was already inclined to fight on your behalf. This effect ends on a target after 1 hour, if it takes any damage, if you attack it, or if it witnesses you attacking or damaging any of its allies.  
	If a target succeeds on its save against this effect, the target has no hint that you tried to charm it.  
	Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest. 
 
Charmed: 
• A charmed creature can't attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects. 
 
• The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature.

    <lvl06skill1text>At 6th level, you gain the ability to cloak yourself in a fey magic that makes others want to serve you. As a bonus action, you cast command, without expending a spell slot, and you take on an appearance of unerthly beauty for 1 minute or until your concentration ends (as if you were concentrating on a spell). During this time, you can cast command as a bonus action on each of your turns, without expending a splell slot. 
	Any creature charmed by you automatically fails its saving throw against the command you cast with this feature. 
	Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

    <lvl14skill1text>At 14th level, your appearance permanently gains an otherworldly aspect that makes you look more lovely and fierce. 
	In addition, as a bonus action, you can assume a magically majestic presence for 1 minute or until you are incapacitated. For the duration, whenever any creature tries to attack you for the first time on a turn, the atatcker must make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, it can’t attack you on this turn, and it must choose a new target for its attack or the attack is wasted. On a successful save, it can attack you on this turn but it has disadvantage on any saving throw it makes against your spells on your next turn. 
	Once you assume this majestic presence, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

    <lvl03skill1text>Bards of the College of Lore know something about most things, collecting bits of knowledge from sources as diverse as scholarly tomes and peasant tales. Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate compositions in royal courts, these bards use their gifts to hold audiences spellbound. When the applause dies down, the audience members might find themselves questioning everything they held to be true, from their faith in the priesthood of the local temple to their loyalty to the king. 
	The loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit of beauty and truth, not in fealty to a monarch or following the tenets of a deity. A noble who keeps such a bard as a herald or advisor knows that the bard would rather be honest than politic. 
	The college’s members gather in libraries and sometimes in actual colleges, complete with classrooms and dormitories, to share their lore with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-important figures of authority.

When a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a damage roll, you can use your reaction to expend one of your uses of Bardic Inspiration, rolling a Bardic Inspiration die and subtracting the number rolled from the creature’s roll. You can choose to use this feature after the creature makes its roll, but before the DM determines whether the attack roll or ability check succeeds or fails, or before the creature deals its damage.

    <lvl03skill1text>Bards of the College of Swords are called blades, and they entertain through daring feats of weapon prowess. Blades perform stunts such as sword swallowing, knife throwing and juggling, and mock combats. But though they use their weapons to entertain, they are also highly trained and skilled warriors in their own right. 
	Their talent with weapons inspires many blades to lead double lives. One blade might use a circus troupe as cover for nefarious deeds such as assassination, robbery, and blackmail. Other blades strike at the wicked, bringing justice to bear against the cruel and powerful. Most troupes are happy to accept a blade’s talent for the excitement it adds to a performance, but few entertainers fully trust a blade in their ranks. 
	Blades who abandon lives as entertainers have often run into trouble that makes maintaining their secret activities impossible. A blade caught stealing or engaging in vigilante justice is too great a liability for most troupes. With their weapon skills and magic, these blades either take up work as enforcers for thieves’ guilds or strike out on their own as adventurers.

    <lvl03skill1text>Bards of the College of Valor are daring skalds whose tales keep alive the memory of the great heroes of the past, and thereby inspire a new generation of heroes. These bards gather in mead halls or around great bonfires to sing the deeds of the mighty, both past and present. They travel the land to witness great events firsthand and to ensure that the memory of those events doesn’t pass from the world.

    <lvl03skill1text>Most folk are happy to welcome a bard into their midst. Bards of the College of Whispers use this to their advantage. They appear to be like any other bard, sharing news, singing songs, and telling tales to the audiences they gather. In truth, the College of Whispers teaches its students that they are wolves among sheep. These bards use their knowledge and magic to uncover secrets and turn them against others through extortion and threats.  
	Many other bards hate the College of Whispers, viewing it as a parasite that uses the bards’ reputation to acquire wealth and power. For this reason, members of this college rarely reveal their true nature. They typically claim to follow some other college, or they keep their actual calling secret in order to infiltrate and exploit royal courts and other settings of power. 
</lvl03skill1text>
    <lvl03skill2name>Psychic Blades (College of Whispers)</lvl03skill2name>
    <lvl03skill2text>When you join the College of Whispers at 3rd level, you gain the ability to magically make your weapon attacks toxic to a creature’s mind.  
	When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to deal an additional 2d6 psychic damage to that target. You can do so only once per round on your turn.  
	The psychic damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 3d6 at 5th level, 5d6 at 10th level, and 8d6 at 15th level. 
</lvl03skill2text>
    <lvl03skill3name>Words of Terror (College of Whispers)</lvl03skill3name>
    <lvl03skill3text>At 3rd level, you learn to infuse innocent-seeming words with an insidious magic that can inspire terror. 
	If you speak to a humanoid alone for at least 1 minute, you can attempt to seed paranoia in its mind. At the end of the conversation, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be frightened of you or another creature of your choice. The target is frightened in this way for one hour, until it is attacked or damaged, or until it witnesses its allies being attacked or damaged. 
	If the target succeeds on its save, the target has no hint that you tried to frighten it. 
	Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short rest or long rest. 
 
Frightened: 
• A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight. 
 
• The creature can't willingly move closer to the source of its fear.

    <lvl06skill1name>Mantle of Whispers (College of Whispers)</lvl06skill1name>
    <lvl06skill1text>At 6th level, you gain the ability to adopt a humanoid’s persona. When a humanoid dies within 30 feet of you, you can magically capture its shadow using your reaction. You retain this shadow until you use it or you finish a long rest. 
	You can use the shadow as an action. When you do so, it vanishes, magically tranforming into a disguise that appears on you. You now look like the dead person, but healthy and alive. This diguise lasts for 1 hour or until you end it as a bonus action. 
	While you’re in the disguise, you gain access to all information that the humanoid would freely share with a casual aquaitance. Such information includes general details on itsbackground and personal life, but doesn’t include secrets. The information is enough that you can pass yourself off as the person by drawing on its memories. 
	Another creature can see through this disguise bu succeeding on a Wisdom (Insight) check conetested by your Charisma (Deception) check, You gain a +5 bonus to your check. 
	Once you capture a shadow with this feature, you can’t capture another one with it until you finish a short or long rest.

	As an action, you magically whisper a phrase that only one creature of your choice within 30 feet of you can hear. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. It automatically succeeds if it doesn’t share a language with you or if it can’t hear you. On a successful saving throw, your whisper sounds like unintelligible mumbling and has no effect.  
	If the target fails its saving throw, it is charmed by you for the next 8 hours or until you or your allies attack it, damage it, or force it to make a saving throw. It interprets the whispers as a description of its most mortifying secret. You gain no knowledge of this secret, but the target is convinced you know it.  
	The charmed creature obeys your commands for fear that you will reveal its secret. It won’t risk its life for you or fight for you, unless it was already inclined to do so. It grants you favors and gifts it would offer to a close friend.  
	When the effect ends, the creature has no understanding of why it held you in such fear. 
	Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest. 
 
Charmed: 
• A charmed creature can't attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects. 
 
• The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature.

    <lvl01skill2name>Spellcasting</lvl01skill2name>
    <lvl01skill2text>As a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the cleric spell list. 
 
Cantrips: 
	At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn an additional cleric cantrip of your choice at 4th level and another at 10th level.  
 
Preparing and Casting Spells: 
	The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. 
	You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. 
	For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells. 
	You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.  
 
Spellcasting Ability: 
	Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. 
	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier 
	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier  
 
Ritual Casting: 
	You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.  
 
Spellcasting Focus: 
	You can use a holy symbol (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells. 
</lvl01skill2text>
    <lvl01skill3name>Divine Domain</lvl01skill3name>
    <lvl01skill3text>Choose one domain related to your deity: Knowledge, Life, Light, Nature, Tempest, Trickery, or War. Each domain is detailed at the end of the class description, and each one provides examples of gods associated with it. Your choice grants you domain spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels.  
 
Domain Spells: 
	Each domain has a list of spells — its domain spells — that you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. 
	If you have a domain spell that doesn’t appear on the cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you. 
</lvl01skill3text>
    <lvl02skill1name>Channel Divinity</lvl02skill1name>
    <lvl02skill1text>At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description. 
	When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again. 
	Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save DC. 
	Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.  
</lvl02skill1text>
    <lvl02skill2name>Channel Divinity: Turn Undead</lvl02skill2name>
    <lvl02skill2text>As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. 
	A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action. 
</lvl02skill2text>
    <lvl04skill1name>Ability Score Improvement</lvl04skill1name>
    <lvl04skill1text>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

	If your DM uses the optional Feats, you can instead take a feat. 
</lvl08skill1text>
    <lvl10skill1name>Divine Intervention</lvl10skill1name>
    <lvl10skill1text>Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great. 
	Imploring your deity’s aid requires you to use your action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your cleric level, your deity intervenes. The DM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any cleric spell or cleric domain spell would be appropriate. 
	If your deity intervenes, you can’t use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest. 
	At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required.

    <lvl01skill1text>Magic is an energy that suffuses the multiverse and that fuels both destruction and creation. Gods of the Arcana domain know the secrets and potential of magic intimately. For some of these gods, magical knowledge is a great responsibility that comes with a special understanding of the nature of reality. Other gods of Arcana see magic as pure power, to be used as its wielder sees fit. 
	The gods of this domain are often associated with knowledge, as learning and arcane power tend to go hand-in-hand. In the Realms, deities of this domain include Azuth and Mystra, as well as Corellon Larethian of the elven pantheon. In other worlds, this domain includes Hecate, Math Mathonwy, and Isis; the triple moon gods of Solinari, Lunitari, and Nuitari of Krynn; and Boccob, Vecna, and Wee Jas of Greyhawk.

	As an action, you present your holy symbol, and one celestial, elemental, fey, or fiend of your choice that is within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw, provided that the creature can see or hear you. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. 
	A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly end its move in a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions.

    <lvl01skill1text>The gods of the forge are patrons of artisans who work with metal, from a humble blacksmith who keeps a village in horseshoes and plow blades to the mighty elf artisan whose diamond-tipped arrows of mithral have felled demon lords. The gods of the forge teach that, with patience and hard work, even the most intractable metal can transform from a lump of ore to a beautifully wrought object. Clerics of these deities quest to search for objects lost to the forces of darkness, liberate mines overrun by orcs, and uncover rare and wondrous materials necessary to create potent magic items. Followers of these gods take great pride in their work, and they are willing to craft and use heavy armor and powerful weapons to protect them. Deities of this domain include Gond, Reorx, Onatar, Moradin, Hephaestus, and Goibhniu.

Significant events typically involve powerful emotions, such as battles and betrayals, marriages and murders, births and funerals. However, they might also include more mundane events that are nevertheless important in your current situation.

Their clerics are a disruptive force in the world, puncturing pride, mocking tyrants, stealing from the rich, freeing captives, and flouting hollow traditions. They prefer subterfuge, pranks, deception, and theft rather than direct confrontation. 
 
Trickery Domain Spells: 
	At each indicated cleric level, you add the listed spells to your spells prepared. 
 
1st — charm person, disguise self 
3rd — mirror image, pass without trace 
5th — blink, dispel magic 
7th — dimension door, polymorph 
9th — dominate person, modify memory

    <lvl01skill2name>Blessing of the Trickster (Trickery Domain)</lvl01skill2name>
    <lvl01skill2text>Starting when you choose this domain at 1st level, you can use your action to touch a willing creature other than yourself to give it advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. This blessing lasts for 1 hour or until you use this feature again. 
</lvl01skill2text>
    <lvl02skill1name>Channel Divinity: Invoke Duplicity (Trickery Domain)</lvl02skill1name>
    <lvl02skill1text>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to create an illusory duplicate of yourself. 
	As an action, you create a perfect illusion of yourself that lasts for 1 minute, or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell). The illusion appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of you. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the illusion up to 30 feet to a space you can see, but it must remain within 120 feet of you. 
	For the duration, you can cast spells as though you were in the illusion’s space, but you must use your own senses. Additionally, when both you and your illusion are within 5 feet of a creature that can see the illusion, you have advantage on attack rolls against that creature, given how distracting the illusion is to the target. 
</lvl02skill1text>
    <lvl06skill1name>Channel Divinity: Cloak of Shadows (Trickery Domain)</lvl06skill1name>
    <lvl06skill1text>Starting at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to vanish. 
	As an action, you become invisible until the end of your next turn. You become visible if you attack or cast a spell. 
 
Invisible: 
• An invisible creature is impossible to see without the aid of magic or a special sense. For the purpose of hiding, the creature is heavily obscured. The creature's location can be detected by any noise it makes or any tracks it leaves. 
 
• Attack rolls against the creature have disadvantage, and the creature's attack rolls have advantage. 
</lvl06skill1text>
    <lvl08skill1name>Divine Strike (Trickery Domain)</lvl08skill1name>
    <lvl08skill1text>At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 poison damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8. 
</lvl08skill1text>
    <lvl17skill1name>Improved Duplicity (Trickery Domain)</lvl17skill1name>
    <lvl17skill1text>At 17th level, you can create up to four duplicates of yourself, instead of one, when you use Invoke Duplicity. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move any number of them up to 30 feet, to a maximum range of 120 feet.

    <lvl01skill1text>War has many manifestations. It can make heroes of ordinary people. It can be desperate and horrific, with acts of cruelty and cowardice eclipsing instances of excellence and courage. In either case, the gods of war watch over warriors and reward them for their great deeds. The clerics of such gods excel in battle, inspiring others to fight the good fight or offering acts of violence as prayers. Gods of war include champions of honor and chivalry (such as Torm, Heironeous, and Kiri-Jolith) as well as gods of destruction and pillage (such as Erythnul, the Fury, Gruumsh, and Ares) and gods of conquest and domination (such as Bane, Hextor, and Maglubiyet). Other war gods (such as Tempus, Nike, and Nuada) take a more neutral stance, promoting war in all its manifestations and supporting warriors in any circumstance.

    <lvl01skill1name>Starting Druid</lvl01skill1name>
    <lvl01skill1text>As a 1st-level Druid, you begin play with 8+your Constitution modifier hit points. 
 
You are proficient with the following items, in addition to any proficiencies provided by your race or background. 
• Armor: light armor, medium armor, shields (druids will not wear armor or use shields made of metal)

    <lvl01skill2name>Druidic</lvl01skill2name>
    <lvl01skill2text>You know Druidic, the secret language of druids. You can speak the language and use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message’s presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check but can’t decipher it without magic. 
</lvl01skill2text>
    <lvl01skill3name>Spellcasting</lvl01skill3name>
    <lvl01skill3text>Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the druid spell list.  
 
Cantrips: 
	At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn an additional druid cantrip of your choice at 4th level and another at 10th level.  
 
Preparing and Casting Spells: 
	The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. 
	You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. 
	For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells. 
	You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.  
 
Spellcasting Ability: 
	Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. 
	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier 
	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier  
 
Ritual Casting: 
	You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.  
 
Spellcasting Focus: 
	You can use a druidic focus (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells. 
</lvl01skill3text>
    <lvl02skill1name>Wild Shape</lvl02skill1name>
    <lvl02skill1text>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest. 
	Your druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table (Player’s Handbook, p. 66). 
	At 2nd level, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn’t have a flying or swimming speed. At 4th level, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/2 or lower that doesn’t have a flying speed. At 8th level, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1 or lower. 
	You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die. 
	While you are transformed, the following rules apply. 
 
• Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can’t use them. 
 
• When you transform, you assume the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious. 
 
• You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that you’ve already cast. 
 
• You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can’t use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense. 
 
• You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.  
</lvl02skill1text>
    <lvl02skill2name>Druid Circle</lvl02skill2name>
    <lvl02skill2text>At 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids: the Circle of the Land or the Circle of the Moon, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

	Additionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of your druid spells, as well as any material components that lack a cost and aren’t consumed by a spell. You gain this benefit in both your normal shape and your beast shape from Wild Shape.

    <lvl02skill2name>Balm of the Summer Court (Circle of Dreams)</lvl02skill2name>
    <lvl02skill2text>At 2nd level, you become imbued with the blessings of the Summer Court. You are a font of energy that offers respite from injuries. You have a pool of fey energy represented by a number of d6s equal to your druid level.  
	As a bonus action, you can choose one creature you can see within 120 feet of you and spend a number of those dice equal to half your druid level or less. Roll the spent dice and add them together. The target regains a number of hit points equal to the total. The target also gains 1 temporary hit point per die spent. 
	You regain all expended dice when you finish a long rest.

    <lvl06skill1name>Hearth of Moonlight and Shadow (Circle of Dreams)</lvl06skill1name>
    <lvl06skill1text>At 6th level, home can be wherever you are. During a short or long rest, you can invoke the shadowy power of the Gloaming Court to help guard your respite. At the start of the rest, you touch a point in space, and an invisible, 30-foot-radius sphere of magic appears, centered on that point. Total cover blocks the sphere. 
	While within the sphere, you and your allies gain a +5 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) and Wisdom (Perception) checks, and any light from open flames in the sphere (a campfire, torches, or the like) isn’t visible outside it. 
	The sphere vanishes at the end of the rest or when you leave the sphere.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Alternatively, you can yse your action to teleport one willing creature you touch up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. 
	You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest. 
</lvl10skill1text>
    <lvl14skill1name>Walker in Dreams (Circle of Dreams)</lvl14skill1name>
    <lvl14skill1text>At 14th level, the magic of the Feywild grants you the ability to travel mentally or physically through dreamlands. 
	When you finish a short or long rest, you can cast one of the following spells, without expending a spell slot or requiring material components: dream (with you as the messenger), scrying, or teleportation circle. 
	This use of teleportation circle is special. Rather than opening a portal to a permanent teleportation circle, it opens a portal to the last location where you finished a long rest on your current plane of existence. If you haven’t takena long rest on your current plane, the spell fails but isn’t wasted. 
	Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

    <lvl06skill1name>Land's Stride (Circle of the Land)</lvl06skill1name>
    <lvl06skill1text>Starting at 6th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.

    <lvl14skill1text>When you reach 14th level, creatures of the natural world sense your connection to nature and become hesitant to attack you. When a beast or plant creature attacks you, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your druid spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature must choose a different target, or the attack automatically misses. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours. 
	The creature is aware of this effect before it makes its attack against you.

    <lvl02skill1name>Druid Circle: Circle of the Moon</lvl02skill1name>
    <lvl02skill1text>Druids of the Circle of the Moon are fierce guardians of the wilds. Their order gathers under the full moon to share news and trade warnings. They haunt the deepest parts of the wilderness, where they might go for weeks on end before crossing paths with another humanoid creature, let alone another druid. 
	Changeable as the moon, a druid of this circle might prowl as a great cat one night, soar over the treetops as an eagle the next day, and crash through the undergrowth in bear form to drive off a trespassing monster. The wild is in the druid’s blood. 
</lvl02skill1text>
    <lvl02skill2name>Combat Wild Shape (Circle of the Moon)</lvl02skill2name>
    <lvl02skill2text>When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you gain the ability to use Wild Shape on your turn as a bonus action, rather than as an action. 
	Additionally, while you are transformed by Wild Shape, you can use a bonus action to expend one spell slot to regain 1d8 hit points per level of the spell slot expended. 
</lvl02skill2text>
    <lvl02skill3name>Circle Forms (Circle of the Moon)</lvl02skill3name>
    <lvl02skill3text>The rites of your circle grant you the ability to transform into more dangerous animal forms. Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Wild Shape to transform into a beast with a challenge rating as high as 1 (you ignore the Max. CR column of the Beast Shapes table, but must abide by the other limitations there). 
	Starting at 6th level, you can transform into a beast with a challenge rating as high as your druid level divided by 3, rounded down.

    <lvl02skill1name>Druid Circle: Circle of the Shepherd</lvl02skill1name>
    <lvl02skill1text>Druids of the Circle of the Shepherd commune with the spirits of nature, especially the spirits of beasts and the fey, and call to those spirits for aid. These druids recognize that all living things play a role in the natural world, yet they focus on protecting animals and fey creatures that have difficulty defending themselves. Shepherds, as they are known, see such creatures as their charges. They ward off monsters that threaten them, rebuke hunters who kill more prey than necessary, and prevent civilization from encroaching on rare animal habitats and on sites sacred to the fey. Many of these druids are happiest far from cities and towns, content to spend their days in the company of animals and the fey creatures of the wilds. 
	Members of this circle become adventurers to oppose forces that threaten their charges or to seek knowledge and power that will help them safeguard their charges better. Wherever these druids go, the spirits of the wilderness are with them. 
</lvl02skill1text>
    <lvl02skill2name>Speech of the Woods (Circle of the Shepherd)</lvl02skill2name>
    <lvl02skill2text>At 2nd level, you gain the ability to converse with beasts and many fey. 
	You learn to speak, read, and write Sylvan. In addition, beasts can understand your speech, and you gain the ability to decipher their noises and motions. Most beasts lack the intelligence to convey or understand sophisticated concepts, but a friendly beast could relay what it has seen or heard in the recent past. This ability doesn’t grant you any special friendship with beasts, though you can combine this ability with gifts to curry favor with them as you would with any nonplayer character. 
</lvl02skill2text>
    <lvl02skill3name>Spirit Totem (Circle of the Shepherd)</lvl02skill3name>
    <lvl02skill3text>Starting at 2nd level, you gain the ability to call forth nature spirits to influence the world around you. As a bonus action, you can magically summon an incorporeal spirit to a point you can see within 60 feet of you. The spirit creates an aura in a 30-foot radius around that point. It counts as neither a creature nor an object, though it has the spectral appearance of the creature it represents. 
	As a bonus action, you can move the spirit up to 60 feet to a point you can see. 
	The spirit persists for 1 minute or until you’re incapacitated. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest. 
	The effect of the spirit’s aura depends on the type of spirit you summon from the options below. 
 
Bear Spirit: The bear spirit grants you and your allies its might and endurance. Each creature of your choice in the aura when the spirit appears gains temporary hit points equal to 5 + your druid level. In addition, you and your allies gain advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws while in the aura. 
 
Hawk Spirit: The hawk spirit is a consummate hunter, aiding you and your allies with its keen sight. When a creature makes an attack roll against a target in the spirit’s aura, you can use your reaction to grant advantage to that attack roll. In addition, you and your allies have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks while in the aura. 
 
Unicorn Spirit: The unicorn spirit lends its protection to those nearby. You and your allies gain advantage on all ability checks made to detect creatures in the spirit’s aura. In addition, if you cast a spell with a spell slot that restores hit points to any creature inside or outside the aura, each creature of your choice in the aura also regains hit points equal to your druid level. 
</lvl02skill3text>
    <lvl06skill1name>Mighty Summoner (Circle of the Shepherd)</lvl06skill1name>
    <lvl06skill1text>Startung at 6th level, beasts and fey that you conjure are more resilient than normal. Any beast or fey summoned or created by a spell that you cast gains the following benefits: 
 
	• The creature appears with more hit points than normal: 2 extra hit points per Hit Die it has. 
 
	• The damage from its natural weapons is considered magical for the purpose of overcoming immunity and resistance to nonmagical atatcks and damage. 
</lvl06skill1text>
    <lvl10skill1name>Guardian Spirit (Circle of the Shepherd)</lvl10skill1name>
    <lvl10skill1text>Beginning at 10th level, your Spirit Totem safeguards the beasts and fey that you call forth with your magic. When a beast or fey that you summoned or created with a spell ends its turn in your Spirit Totem aura, that creature regains a number of hit points equal to half your druid level. 
</lvl10skill1text>
    <lvl14skill1name>Faithful Summons (Circle of the Shepherd)</lvl14skill1name>
    <lvl14skill1text>Starting at 14th level, the nature spirits you commune with protect you when you are the most defenseless. If you are reduced to 0 hit points or are incapacitated against your will, you can immediately gain the benefits of conjure animals as if it were cast with a 9th-level spell slot. It summons four beasts of your choice that are challenge rating 2 or lower. The conjured beasts appear within 20 feet of you. If they receive no commands from you, they protect you from harm and attack your foes. The spell lasts for 1 hour, requiring no concentration, or until you dismiss it (no action required).

    <lvl03skill1text>An Arcane Archer studies a unique elven method of archery that weaves magic into attacks to produce supernatural effects. Arcane Archers are some of their most elite warriors among the elves. They stand watch over the fringes of elven domains, keeping a keen eye out for trespassers and using magic-infused arrows to defeat monsters and invaders before they can reach elven settlements. Over the centuries, the methods of these elf archers have been learned by members of other races who can also balance arcane aptitude with archery.

You have two uses of this ability, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest.

</lvl03skill2text>
    <lvl03skill3name>Born to the Saddle (Cavalier)</lvl03skill3name>
    <lvl03skill3text>Starting at 3rd level, your mastery as a rider becomes apparent. You have advantage on saving throws made to avoid falling off your mount. If you fall off your mount and descend no more than 10 feet, you can land on your feet if you’re not incapacitated. 
	Finally, mounting or dismounting a creature costs you only 5 feet of movement, rather than half your speed. 
</lvl03skill3text>
    <lvl03skill4name>Unwavering Mark (Cavalier)</lvl03skill4name>
    <lvl03skill4text>Starting at 3rd level, you can menace your foes, foiling their attacks and punishing them for harming others. When you hit a creature with a  melee weapon attack, you can mark the creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or you die, or if someone else marks the creature. 
	While it is within 5 feet of you, a creature marked by you has disadvantage on any attack roll that doesn’t target you. 
	In addition, if a creature marked by you deals damage to anyone other than you, you can make a special melee weapon attack against the marked creature as a bonus action on your next turn. You have advantage on the attack roll, and if it hits, the attack’s weapon deals extra damage to the target equal to half your fighter level. 
	Regardless of the number of creatures you mark, you can make this special attack a number of times equal to your Strength modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest. 
</lvl03skill4text>
    <lvl07skill1name>Warding Maneuver (Cavalier)</lvl07skill1name>
    <lvl07skill1text>At 7th level, you learn to fend off strikes directed at you, your mount, ot other creatures nearby. If you or a creature you can see within 5 feet of you is hit by an attack, you can roll 1d8 as a reaction if you’re wielding a melee weapon or a shield. Roll the de, and add the number rolled to the target’s AC against that attack. If the attack still hits, the target has resistance against the attack’s damage. 
	You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. 
</lvl07skill1text>
    <lvl10skill1name>Hold the Line (Cavalier)</lvl10skill1name>
    <lvl10skill1text>At 10th level, you become a master of locking down your enemies. Creatures provoke an opportunity attack from you when they move 5 feet or more while within your reach, and if you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, the target’s speed is reduced to 0 until the end of the current turn. 
</lvl10skill1text>
    <lvl15skill1name>Ferocious Charger (Cavalier)</lvl15skill1name>
    <lvl15skill1text>Starting at 15th level, you can run down your foes, whether you’re mounted or not. If you move at least 10 feet in a straight line right before attacking a creature and you hit it with the attack, that target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC * + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or be knocked prone. You can use this feature only once on each of your turns. 
 
Prone: 
• A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition. 
 
• The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls. 
 
• An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage. 
</lvl15skill1text>
    <lvl18skill1name>Vigilant Defender (Cavalier)</lvl18skill1name>
    <lvl18skill1text>Starting at 18th level, you respond to danger with extraordinary vigilance. In combat, you get a special reaction that you can take once on every creature’s turn, except your turn. You can use this special reaction only to make opportunity attacks, and you can’t use it on the same turn that you take your normal reaction.

    <multiclass/>
    <lvl03skill1name>Martial Archetype: Eldritch Knight</lvl03skill1name>
    <lvl03skill1text>The archetypal Eldritch Knight combines the martial mastery common to all fighters with a careful study of magic. Eldritch Knights use magical techniques similar to those practiced by wizards. They focus their study on two of the eight schools of magic: abjuration and evocation. Abjuration spells grant an Eldritch Knight additional protection in battle, and evocation spells deal damage to many foes at once, extending the fighter’s reach in combat. These knights learn a comparatively small number of spells, committing them to memory instead of keeping them in a spellbook. 
</lvl03skill1text>
    <lvl03skill2name>Spellcasting (Eldritch Knight)</lvl03skill2name>
    <lvl03skill2text>When you reach 3rd level, you augment your martial prowess with the ability to cast spells. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the wizard spell list.  
 
Cantrips: You learn two cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn an additional wizard cantrip of your choice at 10th level.  
 
Spell Slots: The Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.  
	For example, if you know the 1st-level spell shield and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast shield using either slot.  
 
Spells Known of 1st-level and Higher: You know three 1st-level wizard spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the abjuration and evocation spells on the wizard spell list. 
	The Spells Known column of the Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table shows when you learn more wizard spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an abjuration or evocation spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level. 
	The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic. 
	Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the wizard spells you know with another spell of your choice from the wizard spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an abjuration or evocation spell, unless you’re replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level from any school of magic.  
 
Spellcasting Ability: Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.  
 
Spell save DC = 8+your proficiency bonus+your Intelligence modifier  
	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus+your Intelligence modifier 
</lvl03skill2text>
    <lvl03skill3name>Weapon Bond (Eldritch Knight)</lvl03skill3name>
    <lvl03skill3text>At 3rd level, you learn a ritual that creates a magical bond between yourself and one weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. The weapon must be within your reach throughout the ritual, at the conclusion of which you touch the weapon and forge the bond. 
	Once you have bonded a weapon to yourself, you can’t be disarmed of that weapon unless you are incapacitated. If it is on the same plane of existence, you can summon that weapon as a bonus action on your turn, causing it to teleport instantly to your hand. 
	You can have up to two bonded weapons, but can summon only one at a time with your bonus action. If you attempt to bond with a third weapon, you must break the bond with one of the other two. 
</lvl03skill3text>
    <lvl07skill1name>War Magic (Eldritch Knight)</lvl07skill1name>
    <lvl07skill1text>Beginning at 7th level, when you use your action to cast a cantrip, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action. 
</lvl07skill1text>
    <lvl10skill1name>Eldritch Strike (Eldritch Knight)</lvl10skill1name>
    <lvl10skill1text>At 10th level, you learn how to make your weapon strikes undercut a creature’s resistance to your spells. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, that creature has disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes against a spell you cast before the end of your next turn. 
</lvl10skill1text>
    <lvl15skill1name>Arcane Charge (Eldritch Knight)</lvl15skill1name>
    <lvl15skill1text>At 15th level, you gain the ability to teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see when you use your Action Surge. You can teleport before or after the additional action. 
</lvl15skill1text>

    <lvl03skill1name>Martial Archetype: Purple Dragon Knight</lvl03skill1name>
    <lvl03skill1text>Purple Dragon Knights are warriors who hail from the kingdom of Cormyr. Pledged to protect the crown, they take the fight against evil beyond the kingdom’s borders. They are tasked with wandering the land as knights errant, relying on their judgment, bravery, and fidelity to guide them in defeating evildoers. 
	A Purple Dragon Knight inspires greatness in others by committing brave deeds in battle. The mere presence of a knight in a hamlet is enough to cause some orcs and bandits to seek easier prey. A lone knight is a skilled warrior, but a knight leading a band of allies can transform even the most poorly equipped militia into a ferocious war band. 
	A knight prefers to lead through deeds, not words. As a knight spearheads an attack, the knight’s actions can awaken reserves of courage and conviction in allies that they never suspected they had. 
</lvl03skill1text>
    <lvl03skill2name>Restriction: Knighthood (Purple Dragon Knight)</lvl03skill2name>
    <lvl03skill2text>Purple Dragon Knights are tied to a specific order of Cormyrean knighthood.

    <lvl03skill3text>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn how to inspire your allies to fight on past their injuries.

    <lvl07skill1text>A Purple Dragon Knight serves as an envoy of the Cormyrean crown. Knights of high standing are expected to conduct themselves with grace. 
	At 7th level, you gain proficiency in the Persuasion skill. If you are already proficient in it, you gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Animal Handling, Insight, Intimidation, or Performance. 
	Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses Persuasion. You receive this benefit regardless of the skill proficiency you gain from this feature. 
</lvl07skill1text>
    <lvl10skill1name>Inspiring Surge (Purple Dragon Knight)</lvl10skill1name>
    <lvl10skill1text>Starting at 10th level, when you use your Action Surge feature, you can choose one creature within 60 feet of you that is allied with you. That creature can make one melee or ranged weapon attack with its reaction, provided that it can see or hear you. 
	Starting at 18th level, you can choose two allies within 60 feet of you, rather than one. 
</lvl10skill1text>
    <lvl15skill1name>Bulwark (Purple Dragon Knight)</lvl15skill1name>
    <lvl15skill1text>Beginning at 15th level, you can extend the benefit of your Indomitable feature to an ally. When you decide to use Indomitable to reroll an Intelligence, a Wisdom, or a Charisma saving throw and you aren’t incapacitated, you can choose one ally within 60 feet of you that also failed its saving throw against the same effect. If that creature can see or hear you, it can reroll its saving throw and must use the new roll.

While you have 0 hit points during that extra turn, taking damage causes death saving throw failures as normal, and three deaths aving throw failures can still kill you.

    <lvl01skill3text>At 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are shortswords and any simple melee weapons that don’t have the two-handed or heavy property. 
	You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a shield. 
 
• You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons. 
 
• You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels — to a d6 at 5th level, a d8 at 11th level, and a d10 at 17th level.  
 
• When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven’t already taken a bonus action this turn. 
 
	Certain monasteries use specialized forms of the monk weapons. For example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter blade (called a kama). Whatever name you use for a monk weapon, you can use the game statistics provided for the weapon in chapter 5. 
</lvl01skill3text>
    <lvl02skill1name>Ki</lvl02skill1name>
    <lvl02skill1text>Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ki points. You have a number of Ki points equal to your monk level. 
	You can spend these points to fuel various ki features. 
	You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind. You learn more ki features as you gain levels in this class. When you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points. 
	Some of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: 
	Ki save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier 
</lvl02skill1text>
    <lvl02skill2name>Flurry of Blows</lvl02skill2name>

	If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free. If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a ranged attack with the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught, as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the missile counts as a monk weapon for the attack, which has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.

The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn. 
 
Stunned: 
• A stunned creature is incapacitated, meaning it can't take actions or reactions, can't move, and can speak only falteringly. 
 
• The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws. 
 
• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.

    <lvl03skill2text>When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you learn magical disciplines that harness the power of the four elements. A discipline requires you to spend ki points each time you use it. 
	You know the Elemental Attunement discipline and one other elemental discipline of your choice, which are detailed in the "Elemental Disciplines" section below. You learn one additional elemental discipline of your choice at 6th, 11th, and 17th level. 
	Whenever you learn a new elemental discipline, you can also replace one elemental discipline that you already know with a different discipline. 
 
Casting Elemental Spells. Some elemental disciplines allow you to cast spells. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting. To cast one of these spells, you use its casting time and other rules, but you don’t need to provide material components for it. 
	Once you reach 5th level in this class, you can spend additional ki points to increase the level of an elemental discipline spell that you cast, provided that the spell has an enhanced effect at a higher level, as burning hands does. The spell’s level increases by 1 for each additional ki point you spend. For example, if you are a 5th-level monk and use Sweeping Cinder Strike to cast burning hands, you can spend 3 ki points to cast it as a 2nd-level spell (the discipline’s base cost of 2 ki points plus 1). 
	The maximum number of ki points you can spend to cast a spell in this way (including its base ki point cost and any additional ki points you spend to increase its level) is determined by your monk level. At 5th level, you may spend up to 3 ki points; this increases to 4 ki points at 9th level, 5 at 13th level, and 6 at 17th level.

    <lvl03skill1text>Monks of the Way of Kensei train relentlessly with their weapons, to the point where the weapon becomes an extension of the body. Founded on a mastery of sword fighting, the tradition has expanded to include many different weapons. 
	A kensei sees a weapon in much the same way a calligrapher or painter regards a pen or brush. Whatever the weapon, the kensei views it as a tool used to express the beauty and precision of the martial arts. That such mastery makes a kensei a peerless warrior is but a side effect of intense devotion, practice, and study.

    <lvl03skill2text>When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, your special martial arts training leads you to master the use of certain weapons. This path also includes instruction on the deft strokes of calligraphy or painting.  
	You gain the following benefits:  
 
Kensei Weapons: Choose two types of weapons to be your kensei weapons: one melee weapon and one ranged weapon. Each of these weapons can be any simple or martial weapon that lacks the heavy and special properties. The longbow is also a valid choice. You gain proficiency with these weapons if you don’t already have it. Weapons of the chosen types are monk weapons for you. Many of this tradition’s features work only with your kensei weapons. When you reach 6th, 11th, and 17th level in this class, you can choose another type of weapon—either melee or ranged—to be a kensei weapon for you, following the criteria above.  
 
Agile Parry:  If you make an unarmed strike as part of the Attack action on your turn and are holding a kensei weapon, you can use it to defend yourself if it is a melee weapon. You gain a +2 bonus to AC until the start of your next turn, while the weapon is in your hand and you aren’t incapacitated.  
 
Kensei Shot: You can use a bonus action on your turn to make your ranged attacks with a kensei weapon more deadly. When you do so, any target you hit with a ranged attack using a kensei weapon takes an extra 1d4 damage of the weapon’s type. You retain this benefit until the end of the current turn. 
 
Way of the Brush: You gain proficiency with your choice of calligrapher’s supplies or painter’s supplies.

Magic Kensei Weapons: Your attacks with your kensei weapons count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.  
 
Deft Strike: When you hit a target with a kensei weapon, you can spend 1 ki point to cause the weapon to deal extra damage to the target equal to your Martial Arts die. You can use this feature only once on each of your turns. 
</lvl06skill1text>
    <lvl11skill1name>Sharpen the Blade (Way of the Kensei)</lvl11skill1name>
    <lvl11skill1text>At 11th level, you gain the ability to augment your weapons further with your ki.

	At 1st level, you know one psionic discipline of your choice. You learn an additional discipline of your choice at 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th level. 
	In addition, whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one discipline you know with a different one of your choice.  
 
Psi Points:  
	You have an internal reservoir of energy that can be devoted to psionic disciplines you know. This energy is represented by psi points. Each psionic discipline describes effects you can create with it by spending a certain number of psi points. A psionic talent requires no psi points.  
	The number of psi points you have is based on your mystic level: 4 points at 1st level, 6 at 2nd, 14 at 3rd, 17 at 4th, 27 at 5th, 32 at 6th, 38 at 7th, 44 at 8th, 57 at 9th, 64 at 10th, and 71 at 18th.. The number shown for your level is your psi point maximum. Your psi point total returns to its maximum when you finish a long rest. The number of psi points you have can’t go below 0 or over your maximum.  
 
Psi Limit:  
	Though you have access to a potent amount of psionic energy, it takes training and practice to channel that energy. There is a limit on the number of psi points you can spend to activate a psionic discipline. The limit is based on your mystic level; at 1st level, your psi limit is 2, and it increases to 3 at 3rd, 5 at 5th, 6 at 7th, and 7 at 9th.  For example, as a 3rd-level mystic, you can spend no more than 3 psi points on a discipline each time you use it, no matter how many psi points you have.  
 
Psychic Focus:  
	You can focus psionic energy on one of your psionic disciplines to draw ongoing benefits from it. As a bonus action, you can choose one of your psionic disciplines and gain its psychic focus benefit, which is detailed in that discipline’s description. The benefit lasts until you are incapacitated or until you use another bonus action to choose a different focus benefit.  
	You can have only one psychic focus benefit at a time, and using the psychic focus of one discipline doesn’t limit your ability to use other disciplines.  
 
Psionic Ability:  
	Intelligence is your psionic ability for your psionic disciplines. You use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a psionic discipline or when making an attack roll with one.  
 
Discipline save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier  
 
Discipline attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

Each order specializes in a specific approach to psionics.

    <lvl04skill2name>Strength of Mind</lvl04skill2name>
    <lvl04skill2text>Even the simplest psionic technique requires a deep understanding of how psionic energy can augment mind and body. This understanding allows you to alter your defenses to better deal with threats. 
	Starting at 4th level, you can replace your proficiency in Wisdom saving throws whenever you finish a short or long rest. To do so, choose Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, or Charisma. You gain proficiency in saves using that ability, instead of Wisdom. This change lasts until you finish your next short or long rest.

    <lvl10skill1name>Consumptive Power</lvl10skill1name>
    <lvl10skill1text>At 10th level, you gain the ability to sacrifice your physical durability in exchange for psionic power. When activating a psionic discipline, you can pay its psi point cost with your hit points, instead of using any psi points. Your current hit points and hit point maximum are both reduced by the number of hit points you spend. This reduction can’t be lessened in any way, and the reduction to your hit point maximum lasts until you finish a long rest. 
	Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

    <lvl11skill1name>Psionic Mastery</lvl11skill1name>
    <lvl11skill1text>Beginning at 11th level, your mastery of psionic energy allows you to push your mind beyond its normal limits. As an action, you gain 9 special psi points that you can spend only on disciplines that require an action or a bonus action to use. You can use all 9 points on one discipline, or you can spread them across multiple disciplines. You can’t also spend your normal psi points on these disciplines; you can spend only the special points gained from this feature. When you finish a long rest, you lose any of these special points that you haven’t spent. 
	If more than one of the disciplines you activate with these points require concentration, you can concentrate on all of them. Activating one of them ends any effect you were already concentrating on, and if you begin concentrating on an effect that doesn’t use these special points, the disciplines end that you’re concentrating on. 
	At 15th level, the pool of psi points you gain from this feature increases to 11. 
	You have one use of this feature, and you regain any expended use of it with a long rest. You gain one additional use of this feature at 13th, 15th, and 17th level.

    <lvl01skill2name>Divine Sense</lvl01skill2name>
    <lvl01skill2text>The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears. As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the hallow spell. 
	You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses. 
</lvl01skill2text>
    <lvl01skill3name>Lay on Hands</lvl01skill3name>
    <lvl01skill3text>Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your paladin level x 5. 
	As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool. 
	Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one. 
	This feature has no effect on undead and constructs. 
</lvl01skill3text>
    <lvl02skill1name>Spellcasting</lvl02skill1name>
    <lvl02skill1text>By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine magic through meditation and prayer to cast spells as a cleric does. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the paladin spell list.  
 
Preparing and Casting Spells: 
	The Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. 
	You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier+half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. 
	For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells. 
	You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.  
 
Spellcasting Ability: 
	Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. 
	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier 
	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier  
 
Spellcasting Focus: 
	You can use a holy symbol (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your paladin spells. 
</lvl02skill1text>
    <lvl02skill2name>Divine Smite</lvl02skill2name>
    <lvl02skill2text>Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon’s damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend. 
</lvl02skill2text>
    <lvl02skill3name>Fighting Style</lvl02skill3name>
    <lvl02skill3text>At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options: Defense, Dueling, Great Weapon Fighting, Mariner, or Protection. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again. 
</lvl02skill3text>
    <lvl02skill4name>Fighting Style: Defense</lvl02skill4name>
    <lvl02skill4text>While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. 
</lvl02skill4text>
    <lvl02skill5name>Fighting Style: Dueling</lvl02skill5name>
    <lvl02skill5text>When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon. 
</lvl02skill5text>
    <lvl02skill6name>Fighting Style: Great Weapon Fighting</lvl02skill6name>
    <lvl02skill6text>When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit. 
</lvl02skill6text>
    <lvl02skill7name>Fighting Style: Protection</lvl02skill7name>
    <lvl02skill7text>When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield. 
</lvl02skill7text>
    <lvl03skill1name>Divine Health</lvl03skill1name>
    <lvl03skill1text>By 3rd level, the divine magic flowing through you makes you immune to disease. 
</lvl03skill1text>
    <lvl03skill2name>Sacred Oath</lvl03skill2name>
    <lvl03skill2text>When you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a paladin forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage, committed to the path but not yet sworn to it. Now you choose the Oath of Devotion, the Oath of the Ancients, or the Oath of Vengeance, all detailed at the end of the class description. 
	Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features include oath spells and the Channel Divinity feature.  
 
Oath Spells: 
	Each oath has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the oath description. Once you gain access to an oath spell, you always have it prepared. Oath spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. 
	If you gain an oath spell that doesn’t appear on the paladin spell list, the spell is nonetheless a paladin spell for you. 
</lvl03skill2text>
    <lvl03skill3name>Channel Divinity</lvl03skill3name>
    <lvl03skill3text>Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to use it. 
	When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again. 
	Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your paladin spell save DC. 
</lvl03skill3text>
    <lvl04skill1name>Ability Score Improvement</lvl04skill1name>
    <lvl04skill1text>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. 
	If your DM uses the optional Feats, you can instead take a feat. 
</lvl04skill1text>
    <lvl05skill1name>Extra Attack</lvl05skill1name>
    <lvl05skill1text>Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. 
</lvl05skill1text>
    <lvl06skill1name>Aura of Protection</lvl06skill1name>
    <lvl06skill1text>Starting at 6th level, whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 feet of you must make a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Charisma modifier (with a minimum bonus of +1). You must be conscious to grant this bonus. 
	At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

    <lvl11skill1name>Improved Divine Smite</lvl11skill1name>
    <lvl11skill1text>By 11th level, you are so suffused with righteous might that all your melee weapon strikes carry divine power with them.

If you also use your Divine Smite with an attack, you add this damage to the extra damage of your Divine Smite. 
</lvl11skill1text>

    <multiclass/>
    <lvl03skill1name>Sacred Oath: Oath of Conquest</lvl03skill1name>
    <lvl03skill1text>The Oath of Conquest calls to paladins who seek glory in battle and the subjugation of their enemies. It isn’t enough for these paladins to establish order. They must crush the forces of chaos. Sometimes called knight tyrants or iron mongers, those who swear this oath gather into grim orders that serve gods or philosophies of war and well-ordered might. 
	Some of these paladins go so far as to consort with the powers of the Nine Hells, valuing the rule of law over the balm of mercy. The archdevil Bel, warlord of Avernus, counts many of these paladins—called hell knights—as his most ardent supporters. Hell knights cover their armor with trophies taken from fallen enemies, a grim warning to any who dare oppose them and the decrees of their lords. These knights are often most fiercely resisted by other paladins of this oath, who believe that the hell knights have wandered too far into darkness. 
 
Tenets of Conquest: A paladin who takes this oath has the tenets of conquest seared on the upper arm. 
 
Douse the Flame of Hope: It is not enough to merely defeat an enemy in battle. Your victory must be so overwhelming that your enemies’ will to fight is shattered forever. A blade can end a life. Fear can end an empire. 
 
Rule with an Iron Fist: Once you have conquered, tolerate no dissent. Your word is law. Those who obey it shall be favored. Those who defy it shall be punished as an example to all who might follow. 
 
Strength Above All: You shall rule until a stronger one arises. Then you must grow mightier and meet the challenge, or fall to your own ruin. 
 
Oath Spells You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed in the Oath of Conquest Spells table. See the Sacred Oath class feature for how oath spells work. 
3rd — armor of Agathys, command 
5th — hold person, spiritual weapon 
9th — bestow curse, fear 
13th — dominate beast, stoneskin 
17th — cloudkill, dominate person. 
</lvl03skill1text>
    <lvl03skill2name>Channel Divinity: Conquering Presence (Oath of Conquest)</lvl03skill2name>
    <lvl03skill2text>You can use your Channel Divinity to exude a terrifying presence. As an action, you force each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature becomes frightened of you for 1 minute. The frightened creature can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. 
</lvl03skill2text>
    <lvl03skill3name>Channel Divinity: Guided Strike (Oath of Conquest)</lvl03skill3name>
    <lvl03skill3text>You can use your Channel Divinity to strike with supernatural accuracy. When you make an attack roll, you can use your Channel Divinity to gain a +10 bonus to the roll. You make this choice after you see the roll, but before the DM says whether the attack hits or misses. 
</lvl03skill3text>
    <lvl07skill1name>Aura of Conquest (Oath of Conquest)</lvl07skill1name>
    <lvl07skill1text>Starting at 7th level, you constantly emanate a menacing aura while you’re not incapacitated. The aura includes your space, extends 10 feet from you in every direction, but not through total cover. 
	If a creature is frightened of you, its speed is reduced to 0 while in the aura, and that creature takes psychic damage equal to half your paladin level if it starts its turn there. 
	At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet. 
</lvl07skill1text>
    <lvl15skill1name>Scornful Rebuke (Oath of Conquest)</lvl15skill1name>
    <lvl15skill1text>Starting at 15th level, those who dare to strike you are psychically punished for their audacity. Whenever a creature hits you with an attack, that creature takes psychic damage equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) if you’re not incapacitated. 
</lvl15skill1text>
    <lvl20skill1name>Invincible Conqueror (Oath of Conquest)</lvl20skill1name>
    <lvl20skill1text>At 20th level, you gain the ability to harness extraordinary martial prowess. As an action, you can magically become an avatar of conquest, gaining the following benefits for 1 minute:

• You have resistance to all damage.

• When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can make one additional attack as part of that action.

• Your melee weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.
	Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

    <lvl03skill1name>Sacred Oath: Oath of Devotion</lvl03skill1name>
    <lvl03skill1text>The Oath of Devotion binds a paladin to the loftiest ideals of justice, virtue, and order. Sometimes called cavaliers, white knights, or holy warriors, these paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor, acting with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater good. They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some, for better or worse, hold the rest of the world to the same standards. Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their gods’ tenets as the measure of their devotion. They hold angels — the perfect servants of good — as their ideals, and incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms.  
 
Tenets of Devotion: 
	Though the exact words and strictures of the Oath of Devotion vary, paladins of this oath share these tenets. 
 
Honesty: Don’t lie or cheat. Let your word be your promise. 
 
Courage: Never fear to act, though caution is wise. 
 
Compassion: Aid others, protect the weak, and punish those who threaten them. Show mercy to your foes, but temper it with wisdom. 
 
Honor: Treat others with fairness, and let your honorable deeds be an example to them. Do as much good as possible while causing the least amount of harm. 
 
Duty: Be responsible for your actions and their consequences, protect those entrusted to your care, and obey those who have just authority over you.  
 
Oath Spells: 
	You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed. 
3rd — protection from evil and good, sanctuary 
5th — lesser restoration, zone of truth 
9th — beacon of hope, dispel magic 
13th — freedom of movement, guardian of faith 
17th — commune, flame strike 
</lvl03skill1text>
    <lvl03skill2name>Channel Divinity: Sacred Weapon (Oath of Devotion)</lvl03skill2name>
    <lvl03skill2text>As an action, you can imbue one weapon that you are holding with positive energy, using your Channel Divinity. For 1 minute, you add your Charisma modifier to attack rolls made with that weapon (with a minimum bonus of +1). The weapon also emits bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light 20 feet beyond that. If the weapon is not already magical, it becomes magical for the duration. 
	You can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If you are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends. 
</lvl03skill2text>
    <lvl03skill3name>Channel Divinity: Turn the Unholy (Oath of Devotion)</lvl03skill3name>
    <lvl03skill3text>As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring fiends and undead, using your Channel Divinity. Each fiend or undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage. 
	A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action. 
</lvl03skill3text>
    <lvl07skill1name>Aura of Devotion (Oath of Devotion)</lvl07skill1name>

    <lvl20skill1name>Holy Nimbus (Oath of Devotion)</lvl20skill1name>
    <lvl20skill1text>At 20th level, as an action, you can emanate an aura of sunlight. For 1 minute, bright light shines from you in a 30-foot radius, and dim light shines 30 feet beyond that.
	Whenever an enemy creature starts its turn in the bright light, the creature takes 10 radiant damage.
	In addition, for the duration, you have advantage on saving throws against spells cast by fiends or undead.
	Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

    <multiclass/>
    <lvl03skill1name>Sacred Oath: Oath of Redemption</lvl03skill1name>
    <lvl03skill1text>The Oath of Redemption sets a paladin on a difficult path, one that requires a holy warrior to use violence only as a last resort. Paladins who dedicate themselves to this oath believe that any person can be redeemed and that the path of benevolence and justice is one that anyone can walk. These paladins face evil creatures in the hope of turning their foes to the light, and they slay their enemies only when such a deed will clearly save other lives. Paladins who follow this path are known as redeemers. 
	While redeemers are idealists, they are no fools. Redeemers know that undead, demons, devils, and other supernatural threats can be inherently evil. Against such foes, paladins who swear this oath bring the full wrath of their weapons and spells to bear. Yet the redeemers still pray that, one day, even creatures of wickedness will invite their own redemption. 
 
Tenets of Redemption: 
	The tenets of the Oath of Redemption hold a paladin to a high standard of peace and justice. 
 
Peace: Violence is a weapon of last resort. Diplomacy and understanding are the paths to long-lasting peace. 
 
Innocence: All people begin life in an innocent state, and it is their environment or the influence of dark forces that drives them to evil. By setting the proper example, and working to heal the wounds of a deeply flawed world, you can set anyone on a righteous path. 
 
Patience: Change takes time. Those who have walked the path of the wicked must be given reminders to keep them honest and true. Once you have planted the seed of righteousness in a creature, you must work day after day to allow it to survive and then flourish. 
 
Wisdom: Your heart and mind must stay clear, for eventually you will be forced to admit defeat. While every creature can be redeemed, some are so far along the path of evil that you have no choice but to end their lives for the greater good. Any such action must be carefully weighed and the consequences fully understood, but once you have made the decision, follow through with it knowing your path is just. 
 
Redemption Spells: 
	You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed. 
 
3rd — sanctuary, sleep 
 
5th —calm emotions, hold person 
 
9th — counterspell, hypnotic pattern 
 
13th — Otiluke’s resilient sphere, stoneskin 
 
17th — hold monster, wall of force 
</lvl03skill1text>
    <lvl03skill2name>Channel Divinity: Emissary of Peace (Oath of Redemption)</lvl03skill2name>
    <lvl03skill2text>You can use your Channel Divinity to augment your presence with divine power. As a bonus action, you grant yourself a +5 bonus to the next Charisma (Persuasion) check you make within the next 10 minutes. 
</lvl03skill2text>
    <lvl03skill3name>Channel Divinity: Rebuke the Violent (Oath of Redemption)</lvl03skill3name>
    <lvl03skill3text>You can use your Channel Divinity to rebuke those who use violence. Immediately after an attacker within 30 feet of you deals damage with an attack against a creature other than you, you can use your reaction to force the attacker to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the attacker takes radiant damage equal to the damage it just dealt. On a successful Save, it takes half as much damage.

    <lvl07skill1name>Aura of the Guardian (Oath of Redemption)</lvl07skill1name>
    <lvl07skill1text>Starting at 7th level, you can shield your allies from harm at the cost of your own health. When a creature within 10 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to magically take that damage, instead of that creature taking it. This feature doesn’t transfer any other effects that might accompany the damage, and this damage can’t be reduced in any way 
	At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet. 
</lvl07skill1text>
    <lvl15skill1name>Protective Spirit (Oath of Redemption)</lvl15skill1name>
    <lvl15skill1text>Starting at 15th level, a holy presence mends your wounds in combat. You regain hit points equal to 1d6 + half your paladin level if you end your turn in combat with fewer than half of your hit points remaining and you aren’t incapacitated. 
</lvl15skill1text>
    <lvl20skill1name>Emissary of Redemption (Oath of Redemption)</lvl20skill1name>
    <lvl20skill1text>At 20th level, you become an avatar of peace, which gives you two benefits:

• You have resistance to all damage dealt by other creatures (their attacks, spells, and other effects).

• Whenever a creature damages you, it takes radiant damage equal to half the amount you take from the attack.
	If you attack a creature, cast a spell on it, or deal damage to it by any means but this feature, neither benefit works against that creature until you finish a long rest.

    <lvl03skill1name>Sacred Oath: Oath of the Ancients</lvl03skill1name>
    <lvl03skill1text>The Oath of the Ancients is as old as the race of elves and the rituals of the druids. Sometimes called fey knights, green knights, or horned knights, paladins who swear this oath cast their lot with the side of the light in the cosmic struggle against darkness because they love the beautiful and life-giving things of the world, not necessarily because they believe in principles of honor, courage, and justice. They adorn their armor and clothing with images of growing things — leaves, antlers, or flowers — to reflect their commitment to preserving life and light in the world.  
 
Tenets of the Ancients: 
	The tenets of the Oath of the Ancients have been preserved for uncounted centuries. This oath emphasizes the principles of good above any concerns of law or chaos. Its four central principles are simple.  
 
Kindle the Light: Through your acts of mercy, kindness, and forgiveness, kindle the light of hope in the world, beating back despair.  
 
Shelter the Light: Where there is good, beauty, love, and laughter in the world, stand against the wickedness that would swallow it. Where life flourishes, stand against the forces that would render it barren.  
 
Preserve Your Own Light: Delight in song and laughter, in beauty and art. If you allow the light to die in your own heart, you can’t preserve it in the world.  
 
Be the Light: Be a glorious beacon for all who live in despair. Let the light of your joy and courage shine forth in all your deeds.

	You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.

    <lvl03skill2name>Channel Divinity: Nature's Wrath (Oath of the Ancients)</lvl03skill2name>
    <lvl03skill2text>You can use your Channel Divinity to invoke primeval forces to ensnare a foe. As an action, you can cause spectral vines to spring up and reach for a creature within 10 feet of you that you can see. The creature must succeed on a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (its choice) or be restrained. While restrained by the vines, the creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, it frees itself and the vines vanish. 
 
Restrained: 
• A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed. 
 
• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage. 
 
• The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws. 
</lvl03skill2text>
    <lvl03skill3name>Channel Divinity: Turn the Faithless (Oath of the Ancients)</lvl03skill3name>
    <lvl03skill3text>You can use your Channel Divinity to utter ancient words that are painful for fey and fiends to hear. As an action, you present your holy symbol, and each fey or fiend within 30 feet of you that can hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage. 
	A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action. 
	If the creature’s true form is concealed by an illusion, shapeshifting, or other effect, that form is revealed while it is turned. 
</lvl03skill3text>
    <lvl07skill1name>Aura of Warding (Oath of the Ancients)</lvl07skill1name>
    <lvl07skill1text>Beginning at 7th level, ancient magic lies so heavily upon you that it forms an eldritch ward. You and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you have resistance to damage from spells. 
	At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet. 
</lvl07skill1text>

    <lvl15skill1text>Starting at 15th level, when you are reduced to 0 hit points and are not killed outright, you can choose to drop to 1 hit point instead. Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest. 
	Additionally, you suffer none of the drawbacks of old age, and you can’t be aged magically. 
</lvl15skill1text>
    <lvl20skill1name>Elder Champion (Oath of the Ancients)</lvl20skill1name>
    <lvl20skill1text>At 20th level, you can assume the form of an ancient force of nature, taking on an appearance you choose. For example, your skin might turn green or take on a bark-like texture, your hair might become leafy or mosslike, or you might sprout antlers or a lion-like mane.
	Using your action, you undergo a transformation. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits.

• At the start of each of your turns, you regain 10 hit points.

• Whenever you cast a paladin spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can cast it using a bonus action instead.

• Enemy creatures within 10 feet of you have disadvantage on saving throws against your paladin spells and Channel Divinity options.

	Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

    <multiclass/>
    <lvl03skill1name>Sacred Oath: Oath of the Crown</lvl03skill1name>
    <lvl03skill1text>The Oath of the Crown is sworn to the ideals of civilization, be it the spirit of a nation, fealty to a sovereign, or service to a deity of law and rulership. The paladins who swear this oath dedicate themselves to serving society and, in particular, the laws that hold society together. These paladins are the watchful guardians on the walls, standing against the chaotic tides of barbarism that threaten to tear down all that civilization has built, and are commonly known as guardians, exemplars, or sentinels. Often, paladins who swear this oath are members of an order of knighthood in service to a nation or sovereign, and undergo their oath as part of their admission to the order’s ranks. 
 
Tenets of the Crown: 
	The tenets of the Oath of the Crown are often set by the sovereign to which their oath is sworn, but generally emphasize the following tenets. 
 
Law: The law is paramount. It is the mortar that holds the stones of civilization together, and it must be respected. 
 
Loyalty: Your word is your bond. Without loyalty, oaths and laws are meaningless. 
 
Courage: You must be willing to do what needs to be done for the sake of order, even in the face of overwhelming odds. If you don’t act, then who will? 
 
Responsibility: You must deal with the consequences of your actions, and you are responsible for fulfilling your duties and obligations.  
 
Oath Spells: 
	You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed. 
 
3rd — command, compelled duel 
5th — warding bond, zone of truth 
9th — aura of vitality, spirit guardians 
13th — banishment, guardian of faith

    <lvl03skill2name>Channel Divinity: Champion Challenge (Oath of the Crown)</lvl03skill2name>
    <lvl03skill2text>As a bonus action, you issue a challenge that compels other creatures to do battle with you. Each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can’t willingly move more than 30 feet away from you. This effect ends on the creature if you are incapacitated or die or if the creature is more than 30 feet away from you. 
</lvl03skill2text>
    <lvl03skill3name>Channel Divinity: Turn the Tide (Oath of the Crown)</lvl03skill3name>

</lvl03skill3text>
    <lvl07skill1name>Divine Allegiance (Oath of the Crown)</lvl07skill1name>
    <lvl07skill1text>Starting at 7th level, when a creature within 5 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to magically substitute your own health for that of the target creature, causing that creature not to take the damage. Instead, you take the damage. This damage to you can’t be reduced or prevented in any way. 
</lvl07skill1text>
    <lvl15skill1name>Unyielding Spirit (Oath of the Crown)</lvl15skill1name>
    <lvl15skill1text>Starting at 15th level, you have advantage on saving throws to avoid becoming paralyzed or stunned.

    <lvl20skill1name>Exalted Champion (Oath of the Crown)</lvl20skill1name>
    <lvl20skill1text>At 20th level, your presence on the field of battle is an inspiration to those dedicated to your cause. You can use your action to gain the following benefits for 1 hour: 

• You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons.

• Your allies have advantage on death saving throws while within 30 feet of you.

• You have advantage on Wisdom saving throws, as do your allies within 30 feet of you.

    <multiclass/>
    <lvl03skill1name>Sacred Oath: Oath of Vengeance</lvl03skill1name>
    <lvl03skill1text>The Oath of Vengeance is a solemn commitment to punish those who have committed a grievous sin. When evil forces slaughter helpless villagers, when an entire people turns against the will of the gods, when a thieves’ guild grows too violent and powerful, when a dragon rampages through the countryside — at times like these, paladins arise and swear an Oath of Vengeance to set right that which has gone wrong. To these paladins — sometimes called avengers or dark knights — their own purity is not as important as delivering justice. 
 
Tenets of Vengeance: 
	The tenets of the Oath of Vengeance vary by paladin, but all the tenets revolve around punishing wrongdoers by any means necessary. Paladins who uphold these tenets are willing to sacrifice even their own righteousness to mete out justice upon those who do evil, so the paladins are often neutral or lawful neutral in alignment. The core principles of the tenets are brutally simple.  
 
Fight the Greater Evil: Faced with a choice of fighting my sworn foes or combating a lesser evil. I choose the greater evil.  
 
No Mercy for the Wicked: Ordinary foes might win my mercy, but my sworn enemies do not.  
 
By Any Means Necessary: My qualms can’t get in the way of exterminating my foes.  
 
Restitution: If my foes wreak ruin on the world, it is because I failed to stop them. I must help those harmed by their misdeeds.  
 
Oath Spells: 
	You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed. 
 
3rd — bane, hunter’s mark 
5th — hold person, misty step 
9th — haste, protection from energy 
13th — banishment, dimension door

</lvl03skill1text>
    <lvl03skill2name>Channel Divinity: Abjure Enemy (Oath of Vengeance)</lvl03skill2name>
    <lvl03skill2text>As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer of denunciation, using your Channel Divinity. Choose one creature within 60 feet of you that you can see. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw, unless it is immune to being frightened. Fiends and undead have disadvantage on this saving throw. 
	On a failed save, the creature is frightened for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. While frightened, the creature’s speed is 0, and it can’t benefit from any bonus to its speed. 
	On a successful save, the creature’s speed is halved for 1 minute or until the creature takes any damage. 
</lvl03skill2text>
    <lvl03skill3name>Channel Divinity: Vow of Enmity (Oath of Vengeance)</lvl03skill3name>
    <lvl03skill3text>As a bonus action, you can utter a vow of enmity against a creature you can see within 10 feet of you, using your Channel Divinity. You gain advantage on attack rolls against the creature for 1 minute or until it drops to 0 hit points or falls unconscious. 
 
Frightened: 
• A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight. 
 
• The creature can't willingly move closer to the source of its fear. 
</lvl03skill3text>
    <lvl07skill1name>Relentless Avenger (Oath of Vengeance)</lvl07skill1name>
    <lvl07skill1text>By 7th level, your supernatural focus helps you close off a foe’s retreat. When you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, you can move up to half your speed immediately after the attack and as part of the same reaction. This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks. 
</lvl07skill1text>
    <lvl15skill1name>Soul of Vengeance (Oath of Vengeance)</lvl15skill1name>
    <lvl15skill1text>Starting at 15th level, the authority with which you speak your Vow of Enmity gives you greater power over your foe. When a creature under the effect of your Vow of Enmity makes an attack, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature if it is within range. 
</lvl15skill1text>
    <lvl20skill1name>Avenging Angel (Oath of Vengeance)</lvl20skill1name>
    <lvl20skill1text>At 20th level, you can assume the form of an angelic avenger. Using your action, you undergo a transformation. For 1 hour, you gain the following benefits.

• Wings sprout from your back and grant you a flying speed of 60 feet.

• You emanate an aura of menace in a 30-foot radius. The first time any enemy creature enters the aura or starts its turn there during a battle, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. Attack rolls against the frightened creature have advantage.

    <lvl03skill1name>Sacred Oath: Oathbreaker</lvl03skill1name>
    <lvl03skill1text>An Oathbreaker is a paladin who breaks his or her sacred oaths to pursue some dark ambition or serve an evil power. Whatever light burned in the paladin’s heart has been extinguished. Only darkness remains. 
	A paladin must be evil and at least 3rd level to become an Oathbreaker. The paladin replaces the features specific to his or her Sacred Oath with Oathbreaker features. 
 
Oathbreaker Spells: 
	An Oathbreaker paladin loses previously gained oath spells and instead gains the following Oathbreaker spells at the paladin levels listed. 
 
3rd — hellish rebuke, inflict wounds 
5th — crown of madness, darkness 
9th — animate dead, bestow curse

</lvl03skill1text>
    <lvl03skill2name>Channel Divinity: Control Undead (Oathbreaker)</lvl03skill2name>
    <lvl03skill2text>As an action, the paladin targets one undead creature he or she can see within 30 feet of him or her. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target must obey the paladin’s commands for the next 24 hours, or until the paladin uses this Channel Divinity option again. An undead whose challenge rating is equal to or greater than the paladin’s level is immune to this effect. 
</lvl03skill2text>
    <lvl03skill3name>Channel Divinity: Dreadful Aspect (Oathbreaker)</lvl03skill3name>
    <lvl03skill3text>As an action, the paladin channels the darkest emotions and focuses them into a burst of magical menace. Each creature of the paladin’s choice within 30 feet of the paladin must make a Wisdom saving throw if it can see the paladin. On a failed save, the target is frightened of the paladin for 1 minute. If a creature frightened by this effect ends its turn more than 30 feet away from the paladin, it can attempt another Wisdom saving throw to end the effect on it. 
 
Frightened: 
• A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight. 
 
• The creature can't willingly move closer to the source of its fear. 
</lvl03skill3text>
    <lvl07skill1name>Aura of Hate (Oathbreaker)</lvl07skill1name>
    <lvl07skill1text>Starting at 7th level, the paladin, as well as any fiends and undead within 10 feet of the paladin, gains a bonus to melee weapon damage rolls equal to the paladin’s Charisma modifier (minimum of +1). A creature can benefit from this feature from only one paladin at a time. 
	At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet. 
</lvl07skill1text>
    <lvl15skill1name>Supernatural Resistance (Oathbreaker)</lvl15skill1name>
    <lvl15skill1text>At 15th level, the paladin gains resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons. 
</lvl15skill1text>
    <lvl20skill1name>Dread Lord (Oathbreaker)</lvl20skill1name>
    <lvl20skill1text>At 20th-level, the paladin can, as an action, surround himself or herself with an aura of gloom that lasts for 1 minute. The aura reduces any bright light in a 30-foot radius around the paladin to dim light. Whenever an enemy that is frightened by the paladin starts its turn in the aura, it takes 4d10 psychic damage. Additionally, the paladin and creatures he or she chooses in the aura are draped in deeper shadow. Creatures that rely on sight have disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures draped in this shadow.
	While the aura lasts, the paladin can use a bonus action on his or her turn to cause the shadows in the aura to attack one creature. The paladin makes a melee spell attack against the target. If the attack hits, the target takes necrotic damage equal to 3d10 +the paladin’s Charisma modifier.
	After activating the aura, the paladin can’t do so again until he or she finishes a long rest.

    <lvl01skill2text>Beginning at 1st level, you have significant experience studying, tracking, hunting, and even talking to a certain type of enemy. 
	Choose a type of favored enemy: aberrations, beasts, celestials, constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, monstrosities, oozes, plants, or undead. Alternatively, you can select two races of humanoid (such as gnolls and orcs) as favored enemies. 
	You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track your favored enemies, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about them.

</lvl01skill3text>
    <lvl02skill1name>Spellcasting</lvl02skill1name>
    <lvl02skill1text>By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the ranger spell list.  
 
Spell Slots: 
	The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. 
	For example, if you know the 1st-level spell animal friendship and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast animal friendship using either slot.  
 
Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher: 
	You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell list. 
	You learn an additional ranger spell of your choice at each odd numbered level thereafter. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level. 
	Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.  
 
Spellcasting Ability: 
	Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. 
	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier 
	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

For 1 minute per level of the spell slot you expend, you can sense whether the following types of creatures are present within 1 mile of you (or within up to 6 miles if you are in your favored terrain): aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. This feature doesn’t reveal the creatures’ location or number. 
</lvl03skill1text>

    <lvl10skill1text>Starting at 10th level, you can spend 1 minute creating camouflage for yourself. You must have access to fresh mud, dirt, plants, soot, and other naturally occurring materials with which to create your camouflage. 
	Once you are camouflaged in this way, you can try to hide by pressing yourself up against a solid surface, such as a tree or wall, that is at least as tall and wide as you are. You gain a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks as long as you remain there without moving or taking actions. Once you move or take an action or a reaction, you must camouflage yourself again to gain this benefit.

    <lvl03skill1name>Ranger Archetype: Beast Master</lvl03skill1name>
    <lvl03skill1text>The Beast Master archetype embodies a friendship between the civilized races and the beasts of the world. United in focus, beast and ranger work as one to fight the monstrous foes that threaten civilization and the wilderness alike. Emulating the Beast Master archetype means committing yourself to this ideal, working in partnership with an animal as its companion and friend. 
</lvl03skill1text>
    <lvl03skill2name>Ranger's Companion (Beast Master)</lvl03skill2name>
    <lvl03skill2text>At 3rd level, you gain a beast companion that accompanies you on your adventures and is trained to fight alongside you. Choose a beast that is no larger than Medium and that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower. Add your proficiency bonus to the beast’s AC, attack rolls, and damage rolls, as well as to any saving throws and skills it is proficient in. Its hit point maximum equals the hit point number in its stat block or four times your ranger level, whichever is higher. Like any creature, it can spend Hit Dice during a short rest to regain hit points. 
	The beast obeys your commands as best as it can. It takes its turn on your initiative, though it doesn’t take an action unless you command it to. On your turn, you can verbally command the beast where to move (no action required by you). You can use your action to verbally command it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, Dodge, or Help action. Once you have the Extra Attack feature, you can make one weapon attack yourself when you command the beast to take the Attack action. 
	If you are incapacitated or absent, the beast acts on its own, focusing on protecting you and itself. The beast never requires your command to use its reaction, such as when making an opportunity attack. 
	While traveling through your favored terrain with only the beast, you can move stealthily at a normal pace. 
	If the beast dies, you can obtain a new companion by spending 8 hours magically bonding with a beast that isn’t hostile to you and that meets the requirements.

    <lvl03skill1name>Roguish Archetype: Arcane Trickster</lvl03skill1name>
    <lvl03skill1text>Some rogues enhance their fine-honed skills of stealth and agility with magic, learning tricks of enchantment and illusion. These rogues include pickpockets and burglars, but also pranksters, mischief-makers, and a significant number of adventurers. 
</lvl03skill1text>
    <lvl03skill2name>Spellcasting (Arcane Trickster)</lvl03skill2name>
    <lvl03skill2text>When you reach 3rd level, you gain the ability to cast spells. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the wizard spell list.  
 
Cantrips: You learn three cantrips: mage hand and two other cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn another wizard cantrip of your choice at 10th level.  
 
Spell Slots: The Arcane Trickster Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. 
	For example. if you know the 1st-level spell charm person and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast charm person using either slot.  
 
Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher: You know three 1st-level wizard spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the enchantment and illusion spells on the wizard spell list.  
	You learn one additional spell at 4th, 7th, 8th, 10th, 11th, 13th, 14th, 16th, 19th, and 20th level. Each of these spells must be an enchantment or illusion spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this c1ass. you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.  
	The spells you learn at 8th. 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.  
	Whenever you gain a level in this c1ass, you can replace one of the wizard spells you know with another spell of your choice from the wizard spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an enchantment or illusion spell, unless you’re replacing the spell you gained at 8th, 14th, or 20th level.  
 
Spellcasting Ability: Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.  
 
Spell save DC = 8+your proficiency bonus+your Intelligence modifier  
	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus+your Intelligence modifier 
</lvl03skill2text>
    <lvl03skill3name>Mage Hand Legerdemain (Arcane Trickster)</lvl03skill3name>
    <lvl03skill3text>Starting at 3rd level, when you cast mage hand, you can make the spectral hand invisible, and you can perform the following additional tasks with it. 
 
• You can stow one object the hand is holding in a container worn or carried by another creature. 
 
• You can retrieve an object in a container worn or carried by another creature. 
 
• You can use thieves’ tools to pick locks and disarm traps at range. 
 
	You can perform one of these tasks without being noticed by a creature if you succeed on a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check contested by the creature’s Wisdom (Perception) check. 
	In addition, you can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to control the hand. 
</lvl03skill3text>
    <lvl09skill1name>Magical Ambush (Arcane Trickster)</lvl09skill1name>
    <lvl09skill1text>Starting at 9th level, if you are hidden from a creature when you cast a spell on it, the creature has disadvantage on any saving throw it makes against the spell this turn. 
</lvl09skill1text>
    <lvl13skill1name>Versatile Trickster (Arcane Trickster)</lvl13skill1name>
    <lvl13skill1text>At 13th level, you gain the ability to distract targets with your mage hand. As a bonus action on your turn, you can designate a creature within 5 feet of the spectral hand created by the spell. Doing so gives you advantage on attack rolls against that creature until the end of the turn. 
</lvl13skill1text>
    <lvl17skill1name>Spell Thief (Arcane Trickster)</lvl17skill1name>
    <lvl17skill1text>At 17th level, you gain the ability to magically steal the knowledge of how to cast a spell from another spellcaster. 
	Immediately after a creature casts a spell that targets you or includes you in its area of effect, you can use your reaction to force the creature to make a saving throw with its spellcasting ability modifier. The DC equals your spell save DC. On a failed save, you negate the spell’s effect against you, and you steal the knowledge of the spell if it is at least 1st level and of a level you can cast (it doesn’t need to be a wizard spell). For the next 8 hours, you know the spell and can cast it using your spell slots. The creature can’t cast that spell until the 8 hours have passed. 
	Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

	Thereafter, if you adopt the new identity as a disguise, other creatures believe you to be that person until given an obvious reason not to.

    <lvl01skill2text>An event in your past, or in the life of a parent or ancestor, left an indelible mark on you, infusing you with arcane magic. This font of magic, whatever its origin, fuels your spells. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the sorcerer spell list.  
 
Cantrips: 
	At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. You learn an additional sorcerer cantrip of your choice at 4th level and another at 10th level.  
 
Spell Slots: 
	The Sorcerer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these sorcerer spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. 
	For example, if you know the 1st-level spell burning hands and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast burning hands using either slot.  
 
Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher: 
	You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. 
	You learn an additional sorcerer spell of your choice at each level except 12th, 14th, 16th, 18th, 19th, and 20th. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level. 
	Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the sorcerer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots. 
 
Spellcasting Ability: 
	Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into the world. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. 
	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier 
	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier 
</lvl01skill2text>
    <lvl01skill3name>Sorcerous Origin</lvl01skill3name>
    <lvl01skill3text>Choose a sorcerous origin, which describes the source of your innate magical power: Draconic Bloodline or Wild Magic, both detailed at the end of the class description. 
	Your choice grants you features when you choose it at 1st level and again at 6th, 14th, and 18th level. 
</lvl01skill3text>
    <lvl02skill1name>Font of Magic</lvl02skill1name>
    <lvl02skill1text>At 2nd level, you tap into a deep wellspring of magic within yourself. This wellspring is represented by sorcery points, which allow you to create a variety of magical effects.  
 
Sorcery Points: 
	You have a number of sorcery points equal to your sorcerer level. You can never have more sorcery points than your sorcerer level. You regain all spent sorcery points when you finish a long rest.  
 
Flexible Casting: 
	You can use your sorcery points to gain additional spell slots, or sacrifice spell slots to gain additional sorcery points. You learn other ways to use your sorcery points as you reach higher levels. Spell slots you create using sorcery poinys are lost at the end of a long rest. 
 
Creating Spell Slots: 
	You can transform unexpended sorcery points into one spell slot as a bonus action on your turn. It costs 2 sorcery points to create a 1st level spell slot, 3 to create a 2nd level slot, 5 for a 3rd level slot, 6 for a 4th level slot, or 7 for a 5th level slot. You can create spell slots no higher in level than 5th. 
	Any spell slot you create with this feature vanishes when you finish a long rest. 
 
Converting a Spell Slot to Sorcery Points: 
	As a bonus action on your turn, you can expend one spell slot and gain a number of sorcery points equal to the slot’s level. 
</lvl02skill1text>
    <lvl03skill1name>Metamagic</lvl03skill1name>
    <lvl03skill1text>At 3rd level, you gain the ability to twist your spells to suit your needs. You gain two of the following Metamagic options of your choice. You gain another one at 10th and 17th level. 
	You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it, unless otherwise noted. 
</lvl03skill1text>
    <lvl03skill2name>Metamagic: Careful Spell</lvl03skill2name>
    <lvl03skill2text>When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the spell’s full force. To do so, you spend 1 sorcery point and choose a number of those creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the spell.  
</lvl03skill2text>
    <lvl03skill3name>Metamagic: Distant Spell</lvl03skill3name>
    <lvl03skill3text>When you cast a spell that has a range of 5 feet or greater, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double the range of the spell. 
	When you cast a spell that has a range of touch, you can spend 1 sorcery point to make the range of the spell 30 feet.  
</lvl03skill3text>
    <lvl03skill4name>Metamagic: Empowered Spell</lvl03skill4name>
    <lvl03skill4text>When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). You must use the new rolls. 
	You can use Empowered Spell even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.  
</lvl03skill4text>
    <lvl03skill5name>Metamagic: Extended Spell</lvl03skill5name>
    <lvl03skill5text>When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double its duration, to a maximum duration of 24 hours.

    <lvl03skill6text>When you cast a spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw to resist its effects, you can spend 3 sorcery points to give one target of the spell disadvantage on its first saving throw made against the spell.  
</lvl03skill6text>
    <lvl03skill7name>Metamagic: Quickened Spell</lvl03skill7name>
    <lvl03skill7text>When you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can spend 2 sorcery points to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting.  
</lvl03skill7text>
    <lvl03skill8name>Metamagic: Subtle Spell</lvl03skill8name>
    <lvl03skill8text>When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to cast it without any somatic or verbal components.  
</lvl03skill8text>
    <lvl03skill9name>Metamagic: Twinned Spell</lvl03skill9name>
    <lvl03skill9text>When you cast a spell that targets only one creature and doesn’t have a range of self, you can spend a number of sorcery points equal to the spell’s level to target a second creature in range with the same spell (1 sorcery point if the spell is a cantrip). 
	To be eligible, a spell must be incapable of targeting more than one creature at the spell’s current level. For example, magic missile and scorching ray aren’t eligible, but ray of frost and chromatic orb are.

    <lvl01skill1name>Sorcerous Origin: Divine Soul</lvl01skill1name>
    <lvl01skill1text>Sometimes the spark of magic that fuels a sorcerer comes from a divine source that glimmers within the soul. Having such a blessed soul is a sign that your innate magic might come from a distant but powerful familial connection to a divine being. Perhaps your ancestor was an angel, transformed into a mortal and sent to fight in a god’s name. Or your birth might align with an ancient prophecy, marking you as a servant of the gods or a chosen vessel of divine magic. 
	A Divine Soul, with a natural magnetism, is seen as a threat ny some religious hierarchies. As an outsider who commands sacred power, a Divine Soul can undermine an existing order by claiming a direct tie to the divine. 
	In some cultures, only those who can claim the power of a Divine Soul may command religious power. In these lands, ecclesiastical positions are dominated by a few bloodlines and preserved over generations. 
</lvl01skill1text>
    <lvl01skill2name>Divine Magic (Divine Soul)</lvl01skill2name>
    <lvl01skill2text>Your link to the divine allows you to learn spells from the cleric class. When your Spellcasting feature lets you learn or replace a sorcerer cantrip or a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher, you can choose the new spell from the cleric spell list or the sorcerer spell list. You must otherwise obey all the restrictions for selecting the spell, and it becomes a sorcerer spell for you.  
	In addition, choose an affinity for the source of your divine power: good, evil, law, chaos, or neutrality. You learn an additional spell based on that affinity, as shown below. It is a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn;t count against your number of sorcerer spells known. If you later replace this spell, you must replace it with a spell from the cleric spell list. 
 
Affinity—Spell: 
Good—cure wounds 
Evil—inflict wounds 
Law—bless 
Chaos—bane 
Neutrality—protection from evil and good 
</lvl01skill2text>
    <lvl01skill3name>Favored by the Gods (Divine Soul)</lvl01skill3name>
    <lvl01skill3text>Starting at 1st level, divine power guards your destiny. If you fail a saving throw or miss with an attack roll, you can roll 2d4 and add it to the total, possibly changing the outcome. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest. 
</lvl01skill3text>
    <lvl06skill1name>Empowered Healing (Divine Soul)</lvl06skill1name>
    <lvl06skill1text>Starting at 6th level, the divine energy coursing through you can empower healing spells. Whenever you or an ally within 5 feet of you roll dice to determine the number of hit points a spell restores, you can spend 1 sorcery point to reroll any number of those dice once, provided you aren’t incapacitated. You can use this feature only once per turn. 
</lvl06skill1text>
    <lvl14skill1name>Otherworldly Wings (Divine Soul)</lvl14skill1name>
    <lvl14skill1text>Starting at 14th level, you can use a bonus action to manifest a pair of spectral wings from your back. While the wings are present, you have a flying speed of 30 feet. The wings last until you’re incapacitated, you die, or you dismiss them as a bonus action. 
	The affinity you chose for your Divine Magic feature determines the appearance of the spectral wings: eagle wings for good or law, bat wings for evil or chaos, and dragonfly wings for neutrality. 
</lvl14skill1text>
    <lvl18skill1name>Unearthly Recovery (Divine Soul)</lvl18skill1name>
    <lvl18skill1text>At 18th level, you gain the ability to overcome grievous injuries. As a bonus action when you have fewer than half of your hit points remaining, you can regain a number of hit points equal to half your hit point maximum. 
	Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

    <lvl01skill1name>Sorcerous Origin: Draconic Bloodline</lvl01skill1name>
    <lvl01skill1text>Your innate magic comes from draconic magic that was mingled with your blood or that of your ancestors. Most often, sorcerers with this origin trace their descent back to a mighty sorcerer of ancient times who made a bargain with a dragon or who might even have claimed a dragon parent. Some of these bloodlines are well established in the world, but most are obscure. Any given sorcerer could be the first of a new bloodline, as a result of a pact or some other exceptional circumstance. 
</lvl01skill1text>
    <lvl01skill2name>Dragon Ancestor</lvl01skill2name>
    <lvl01skill2text>You have a dragon ancestor, tied to the color of your skin. 
	You can speak, read, and write Draconic. Additionally, whenever you make a Charisma check when interacting with dragons, your proficiency bonus is doubled if it applies to the check.Your bloodline also connects you to damage of a certain type. 
Black - Acid 
Blue - Lightning 
Brass - Fire 
Bronze - Lightning 
Copper - Acid 
Gold - Fire 
Green - Poison 
Red - Fire 
Silver - Cold 
White - Cold</lvl01skill2text>
    <lvl01skill3name>Draconic Resilience (Draconic Bloodline)</lvl01skill3name>
    <lvl01skill3text>As magic flows through your body, it causes physical traits of your dragon ancestors to emerge. At 1st level, your hit point maximum increases by 1 and increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class. 
	Additionally, parts of your skin are covered by a thin sheen of dragon-like scales. When you aren’t wearing armor, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity modifier. 
</lvl01skill3text>
    <lvl06skill1name>Elemental Affinity</lvl06skill1name>
    <lvl06skill1text>Starting at 6th level, when you cast a spell that deals the damage type of your bloodline, you can add your Charisma modifier to one damage roll of that spell. At the same time, you can spend 1 sorcery point to gain resistance to that damage type for 1 hour. 
</lvl06skill1text>
    <lvl14skill1name>Dragon Wings (Draconic Bloodline)</lvl14skill1name>
    <lvl14skill1text>At 14th level, you gain the ability to sprout a pair of dragon wings from your back, gaining a flying speed equal to your current speed. You can create these wings as a bonus action on your turn. They last until you dismiss them as a bonus action on your turn. 
	You can’t manifest your wings while wearing armor unless the armor is made to accommodate them, and clothing not made to accommodate your wings might be destroyed when you manifest them. 
</lvl14skill1text>
    <lvl18skill1name>Draconic Presence (Draconic Bloodline)</lvl18skill1name>
    <lvl18skill1text>Beginning at 18th level, you can channel the dread presence of your dragon ancestor, causing those around you to become awestruck or frightened. As an action, you can spend 5 sorcery points to draw on this power and exude an aura of awe or fear (your choice) to a distance of 60 feet. For 1 minute or until you lose your concentration (as if you were casting a concentration spell), each hostile creature that starts its turn in this aura must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed (if you chose awe) or frightened (if you chose fear) until the aura ends. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw is immune to your aura for 24 hours. 
 
Charmed: 
• A charmed creature can't attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects. 
 
• The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature. 
 
Frightened: 
• A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight. 
 
• The creature can't willingly move closer to the source of its fear.

    <lvl01skill1name>Sorcerous Origin: Shadow Magic</lvl01skill1name>
    <lvl01skill1text>You are a creature of shadow, for your innate magic comes from the Shadowfell itself. You might trace your lineage to an entity from that place, or perhaps you were exposed to its fell energy and transformed by it. 
	The power of shadow magic casts a strange pall over your physical presence. The spark of life that sustains you is muffled, as if it struggles to remain viable against the dark energy that imbues your soul. At your option, you can pick from or roll on the following table to create a unique quirk for your character. 
 
d6—Quirk: 
1—You are always icy cold to the touch. 
 
2—When you are asleep, you don’t appear to breathe (though you must still breathe to survive).

    <lvl01skill2name>Eyes of the Dark (Shadow Magic)</lvl01skill2name>
    <lvl01skill2text>Starting at 1st level, you have darkvision with a range of 120 feet. 
	When you reach 3rd level in this class, you learn the darkness spell, which doesn’t count against your number of sorcerer spells known. In addition, you can cast it by spending 2 sorcery points or by expending a spell slot. If you cast it with sorcery points, you can see through the darkness created by the spell. 
</lvl01skill2text>
    <lvl01skill3name>Strength of the Grave (Shadow Magic)</lvl01skill3name>
    <lvl01skill3text>Starting at 1st level, your existence in a twilight state between life and death makes you difficult to defeat. When damage reduces you to 0 hit points, you can make a Charisma saving throw (DC 5+the damage taken). On a success, you instead drop to 1 hit point. You cannot use this feature if you are reduced to 0 hit points by radiant damage or by a critical hit. 
	After the saving throw succeeds, you can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest. 
</lvl01skill3text>
    <lvl06skill1name>Hound of Ill Omen (Shadow Magic)</lvl06skill1name>
    <lvl06skill1text>At 6th level, you gain the ability to call forth a howling creature of darkness to harass your foes. As a bonus action, you can spend 3 sorcery points to magically summon a hound of ill omen to target one creature you can see within 120 feet of you. The hound uses the dire wolf’s statistics with the following changes: 
 
• The hound is size Medium, not Large, and it counts as a monstosity, not a beast. 
 
• It appears with a number of temporary hit points equal to half your sorcerer level. 
 
• It can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. The hound takes 5 force damage if it ends its turn inside an object. 
 
• At the start of its turn, the hound automatically knows its target’s location. If the target was hidden, it is no longer hidden from the hound. 
 
	The hound appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within 30 feet of the target. Roll initiative for the hound. On its turn, it can move only toward its target by the most direct route, and it can use its action only to attack its target. The hound makes opportunity attacks, but only against its target. Additionally, while the hound is within 5 feet if the target, the target has disadvantage on saving throws against any spell you cast. The hound disappears if it is reduced to 0 hit points, if its target is reduced to 0 hit points, or after 5 minutes. 
</lvl06skill1text>
    <lvl14skill1name>Shadow Walk (Shadow Magic)</lvl14skill1name>
    <lvl14skill1text>At 14th level, you gain the ability to step from one shadow into another. When you are in dim light or darkness, as a bonus action, you can teleport up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space you can see that is also in dim light or darkness. 
</lvl14skill1text>
    <lvl18skill1name>Umbral Form (Shadow Magic)</lvl18skill1name>
    <lvl18skill1text>Starting at 18th level, you can spend 6 sorcery points as a bonus action to magically transform yourself into a shadowy form.

You take 5 force damage if you end your turn inside an object. 
	You remain in this form for 1 minute. It ends early if you are incapacitated, if you die, or if you dismiss it as a bonus action.

    <lvl01skill1text>Your innate magic comes from the power of elemental air. Many with this power can trace their magic back to a near-death experience caused by the Great Rain, but perhaps you were born during a howling gale so powerful that folk still tell stories of it, or your lineage might include the influence of potent air creatures such as vaati or djinn Whatever the case, the magic of the storm permeates your being. 
	Storm sorcerers are invaluable members of a ship’s crew. Their magic allows them to exert control over wind and weather in their immediate area. Their abilities also prove useful in repelling attacks by sahuagin, pirates, and other waterborne threats.

    <lvl06skill1name>Heart of the Storm (Storm Sorcery)</lvl06skill1name>
    <lvl06skill1text>At 6th level, you gain resistance to lightning and thunder damage. In addition, whenever you start casting a spell of 1st level or higher that deals lightning or thunder damage, stormy magic erupts from you.

    <lvl01skill2name>Wild Magic Surge (Wild Magic)</lvl01skill2name>
    <lvl01skill2text>Starting when you choose this origin at 1st level, your spellcasting can unleash surges of untamed magic. Once per turn, the DM can have you roll a d20 immediately after you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher. If you roll a 1, roll on the Wild Magic Surge table to create a magical effect. If that effect is a spell, it is too wild to be affected by your Metamagic, and if it normally requires concentration, it doesn’t require concentration in this case; the spell lasts for its full duration.  
Wild Magic Surge:  
d100 — Effect:  
01-02 — Roll on this table at the start of each of your turns for the next minute, ignoring this result on subsequent rolls.

    <lvl01skill2name>Pact Magic</lvl01skill2name>
    <lvl01skill2text>Your arcane research and the magic bestowed on you by your patron have given you facility with spells. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the warlock spell list.  
 
Cantrips: 
	You know two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. You learn an additional warlock cantrip of your choice at 4th level, and another at 10th level.  
 
Spell Slots: 
	The Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest. 
	For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell witch bolt you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.  
 
Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher: 
	At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list. 
	You learn an additional warlock spell at 2nd through 9th level, and at every odd level thereafter. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level. 
	Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.  
 
Spellcasting Ability: 
	Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. 
	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier 
	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier  
 
Spellcasting Focus: 
	You can use an arcane focus (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells.

    <lvl02skill1name>Otherworldly Patron</lvl02skill1name>
    <lvl02skill1text>At 1st level, you have struck a bargain with an otherworldly being of your choice: the Archfey, the Fiend, or the Great Old One, each of which is detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 1st level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

	At 2nd level, you gain two eldritch invocations of your choice. Your invocation options are detailed at the end of the class description. When you gain certain warlock levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice. You gain an additional invocation at 5th, 7th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th warlock level. 
	Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level.

    <lvl03skill2name>Pact Boon: Pact of the Blade</lvl03skill2name>
    <lvl03skill2text>You can use your action to create a pact weapon in your empty hand. You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you create it (see chapter 5 for weapon options). You are proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. 
	Your pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die. 
	You can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter. You can’t affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks.

    <lvl03skill3name>Pact Boon: Pact of the Chain</lvl03skill3name>
    <lvl03skill3text>You learn the find familiar spell and can cast it as a ritual. The spell doesn’t count against your number of spells known.

	Additionally, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack of its own with its reaction. 
</lvl03skill3text>
    <lvl03skill4name>Pact Boon: Pact of the Tome</lvl03skill4name>

When you gain this feature, choose three cantrips from any class’s spell list (the three needn’t be from the same list). While the book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They don’t count against your number of cantrips known. If they don’t appear on the warlock spell list, they are nonetheless warlock spells for you. 
	If you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book turns to ash when you die.

    <lvl01skill1name>Otherworldly Patron: The Archfey</lvl01skill1name>
    <lvl01skill1text>Your patron is a lord or lady of the fey, a creature of legend who holds secrets that were forgotten before the mortal races were born. This being’s motivations are often inscrutable, and sometimes whimsical, and might involve a striving for greater magical power or the settling of age-old grudges. Beings of this sort include the Prince of Frost; the Queen of Air and Darkness, ruler of the Gloaming Court; Titania of the Summer Court; her consort Oberon, the Green Lord; Hyrsam, the Prince of Fools; and ancient hags.

As an action, you can cause each creature in a 10-foot cube originating from you to make a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. The creatures that fail their saving throws are all charmed or frightened by you (your choice) until the end of your next turn. 
	Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest. 
 
Charmed: 
• A charmed creature can't attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects.

    <lvl06skill1name>Misty Escape (The Archfey)</lvl06skill1name>
    <lvl06skill1text>Starting at 6th level, you can vanish in a puff of mist in response to harm. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to turn invisible and teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. You remain invisible until the start of your next turn or until you attack or cast a spell. 
	Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest. 
 
Invisible: 
• An invisible creature is impossible to see without the aid of magic or a special sense. For the purpose of hiding, the creature is heavily obscured. The creature's location can be detected by any noise it makes or any tracks it leaves. 
 
• Attack rolls against the creature have disadvantage, and the creature's attack rolls have advantage. 
</lvl06skill1text>
    <lvl09skill1name>Beguiling Defenses (The Archfey)</lvl09skill1name>
    <lvl09skill1text>Beginning at 10th level, your patron teaches you how to turn the mind-affecting magic of your enemies against them. You are immune to being charmed, and when another creature attempts to charm you, you can use your reaction to attempt to turn the charm back on that creature. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC or be charmed by you for 1 minute or until the creature takes any damage. 
 
Charmed: 
• A charmed creature can't attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects. 
 
• The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature.

    <lvl14skill1name>Dark Delirium (The Archfey)</lvl14skill1name>
    <lvl14skill1text>Starting at 14th level, you can plunge a creature into an illusory realm. As an action, choose a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. It must make a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. On a failed save, it is charmed or frightened by you (your choice) for 1 minute or until your concentration is broken (as if you are concentrating on a spell). This effect ends early if the creature takes any damage. 
	Until this illusion ends, the creature thinks it is lost in a misty realm, the appearance of which you choose. The creature can see and hear only itself, you, and the illusion. 
	You must finish a short or long rest before you can use this feature again.

    <lvl01skill1text>Your patron is a powerful being of the Upper Planes.

Your pact with that being allows you to experience the barest touch of the holy light that illuminates the multiverse. 
	Being connected to such power can cause changes in your behavior and beliefs. You might find yourself driven to annihilate the undead, to defeat fiends, and to protect the innocent. At times, your heart might also be filled with a longing for the celestial realm of your patron, and a desire to wander that paradise for the rest of your days. But you know that your mission is among mortals for now and that your pact binds you to bring light to the dark places of the world.

	As a bonus action, you can heal one  creature you can see within 60 feet of you, spending dice from the pool. The maximum number of dice you can spend at once equals your Charisma modifier (minimum of one die).

You regain hit points equal to half your hit point maximum, and then you stand up, if you so choose. Each creature of your choice that is within 30 feet of you takes radiant damage equal to 2d8 + your Charisma modifier, and it is blinded until the end of the current turn.

It might come from the Far Realm, the space beyond reality, or it could be one of the elder gods known only in legends. Its motives are incomprehensible to mortals, and its knowledge so immense and ancient that even the greatest libraries pale in comparison to the vast secrets it holds. The Great Old One might be unaware of your existence or entirely indifferent to you, but the secrets you have learned allow you to draw your magic from it. Entities of this type include Ghaunadar, called That Which Lurks; Tharizdun, the Chained God; Dendar, the Night Serpent; Zargon, the Returner; Great Cthulhu; and other unfathomable beings.

    <lvl14skill1text>At 14th level, you gain the ability to infect a humanoid’s mind with the alien magic of your patron. You can use your action to touch an incapacitated humanoid.

    <lvl01skill1name>Otherworldly Patron: The Hexblade</lvl01skill1name>
    <lvl01skill1text>You have made your pact with a mysterious entity from the Shadowfell—a force that manifests in sentient magic weapons carved from the stuff of shadow. The mighty sword Blackrazor is the most notable of these weapons, several of which have spread across the multiverse over the ages. The shadowy force behind these weapons can offer power to warlocks who form pacts with it. Many hexblade warlocks create weapons that emulate those formed in the Shadowfell. Others forgo such arms, content to weave the dark magic of that plane into their spellcasting. 
	Because the Raven Queen is known to have forged the first of these weapons, many sages speculate that she and the force are one and that the weapons, along with hexblade warlocks, are tools she uses to manipulate events on the Material Plane to her inscrutable ends. 
 
Expanded Spell List: 
	The Hexblade lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

    <lvl01skill2text>Starting at 1st level, you gain the ability to place a baleful curse on someone. As a bonus action, choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target is cursed for 1 minute. The curse ends early if the target dies, you die, or you are incapacitated. Until the curse ends, you gain the following benefits: 
 
• You gain a bonus to damage rolls against the cursed target. The bonus equals your proficiency bonus. 
 
• Any attack roll you make against the cursed target is a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.

	The influence of your patron also allows you to mystically channel your will through a particular weapon. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch one weapon that you are proficient with and that lacks the two-handed property. When you attack with that weapon, you can use your Charisma modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls. This benefit lasts until you finish a long rest. If you later gain the Pact of the Blade feature, this benefit extends to every pact weapon you conjure with that feature, no matter the weapon’s type.

    <lvl06skill1name>Accursed Specter (Hexblade)</lvl06skill1name>
    <lvl06skill1text>Starting at 6th level, you can curse the soul of a person you slay, temporarily binding it to your service. When you slay a humanoid, you can cause its spirit to rise from its corpse as a specter, the statistics for which are in the Monster Manual. When the specter appears, it gains temporary hit points equal to half your warlock level. Roll initiative for the specter, which has its own turns. It obeys your verbal commands, and it gains a special bonus to attack equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of +0). 
	The specter remains in your service until the end of your next long rest, at which point it vanishes to the afterlife.

    <lvl01skill1text>Death holds no sway over your patron, who has unlocked the secrets of everlasting life, although such a prize—like all power—comes at a price. Once mortal, the Undying has seen mortal lifetimes pass like the seasons, like the flicker of endless days and nights. It has the secrets of the ages to share, secrets of life and death. Beings of this sort include Vecna, Lord of the Hand and the Eye; the dread Iuz; the lich-queen Vol; the Undying Court of Aerenal; Vlaakith, lich-queen of the githyanki; and the deathless wizard Fistandantalus. 
	In the Realms, Undying patrons include Larloch the Shadow King, legendary master of Warlock’s Crypt, and Gilgeam, the God-King of Unther. 
 
Expanded Spell List: 
	The Undying lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you. 
 
1st — false life, ray of sickness 
2nd — blindness/deafness, silence 
3rd — feign death, speak with dead 
4th — aura of life, death ward 
5th — contagion, legend lore 
</lvl01skill1text>
    <lvl01skill2name>Among the Dead (The Undying)</lvl01skill2name>
    <lvl01skill2text>Starting at 1st level, you learn the spare the dying cantrip, which counts as a warlock cantrip for you. You also have advantage on saving throws against any disease. 
	Additionally, undead have difficulty harming you. If an undead targets you directly with an attack or a harmful spell, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC (an undead needn’t make the save when it includes you in an area effect, such as the explosion of fireball). On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or forfeit targeting someone instead of you, potentially wasting the attack or spell. On a succesful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours. An undead is also immune to this effect for 24 hours if you target it with an attack or a harmful spell. 
</lvl01skill2text>
    <lvl06skill1name>Defy Death (The Undying)</lvl06skill1name>
    <lvl06skill1text>Starting at 6th level, you can give yourself vitality when you cheat death or when you help someone else cheat it. You can regain hit points equal to 1d8 + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 hit point) when you succeed on a death saving throw or when you satbilize a creature with spare the dying. 
	Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest. 
</lvl06skill1text>
    <lvl09skill1name>Undying Nature (The Undying)</lvl09skill1name>
    <lvl09skill1text>Beginning at 10th level, you can hold your breath indefinitely, and you don’t require food, water, or sleep, although you still require rest to reduce exhaustion and still benefit from finishing short and long rests. 
	In addition, you age at a slower rate. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year, and you are immune to being magically aged. 
</lvl09skill1text>
    <lvl14skill1name>Indestructible Life (The Undying)</lvl14skill1name>
    <lvl14skill1text>When you reach 14th level, you partake some of the true secrets of the Undying. On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d8 + your warlock level. Additionally, if you put a severed body part of yours back in place when you use this feature, the part reattaches.

</lvl01skill1text>
    <lvl01skill2name>Spellcasting</lvl01skill2name>
    <lvl01skill2text>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the wizard spell list.  
 
Cantrips: 
	At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn an additional wizard cantrip of your choice at 4th level, and another at 10th level. 
 
Spellbook: 
	At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice.  
 
Preparing and Casting Spells: 
	The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. 
	You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so. choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. 
	For example, if you’re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells. 
	You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.  
 
Spellcasting Ability: 
	Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. 
	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier 
	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your intelligence modifier  
 
Ritual Casting: 
	You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don’t need to have the spell prepared.  
 
Spellcasting Focus: 
	You can use an arcane focus (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.  
 
Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher: 
	Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook. 
</lvl01skill2text>
    <lvl01skill3name>Spellbook</lvl01skill3name>
    <lvl01skill3text>The spells of 1st level and higher that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library. 
 
Copying a Spell into the Book: 
	When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it. 
	Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation. 
	For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells. 
 
Replacing the Book: 
	You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book — for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell. 
	If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place. 
 
The Book’s Appearance: 
	Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap. 
</lvl01skill3text>
    <lvl01skill4name>Arcane Recovery</lvl01skill4name>
    <lvl01skill4text>You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. 
	For example, if you’re a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots. 
</lvl01skill4text>
    <lvl02skill1name>Arcane Tradition</lvl02skill1name>
    <lvl02skill1text>When you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping your practice of magic through one of eight schools: Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, or Transmutation, all detailed at the end of the class description.

If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal. 
	By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the same levels.

    <lvl02skill3text>Starting at 2nd level when you choose this school, your soft words and enchanting gaze can magically enthrall another creature. As an action, choose one creature that you can see within 5 feet of you. If the target can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your wizard spell save DC or be charmed by you until the end of your next turn. The charmed creature’s speed drops to 0, and the creature is incapacitated and visibly dazed. 
	On subsequent turns, you can use your action to maintain this effect, extending its duration until the end of your next turn. However, the effect ends if you move more than 5 feet away from the creature, if the creature can neither see nor hear you, or if the creature takes damage. 
	Once the effect ends, or if the creature succeeds on its initial saving throw against this effect, you can’t use this feature on that creature again until you finish a long rest. 
 
Charmed: 
• A charmed creature can't attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects.

    <lvl06skill1text>Beginning at 6th level, when a creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to divert the attack, provided that another creature is within the attack’s range. The attacker must make a Wisdom saving throw against your wizard spell save DC. On a failed save, the attacker must target the creature that is closest to it, not including you or itself. If multiple creatures are closest, the attacker chooses which one to target. On a successful save, you can’t use this feature on the attacker again until you finish a long rest. 
	You must choose to use this feature before knowing whether the attack hits or misses. Creatures that can’t be charmed are immune to this effect.

	Additionally, once before the spell expires, you can use your action to try to make the chosen creature forget some of the time it spent charmed. The creature must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw against your wizard spell save DC or lose a number of hours of its memories equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). You can make the creature forget less time, and the amount of time can’t exceed the duration of your enchantment spell.

You can do this on your turn as a bonus action while the spell is ongoing. The object remains real for 1 minute. For example, you can create an illusion of a bridge over a chasm and then make it real long enough for your allies to cross.

You don’t gain this benefit for killing constructs or undead. 
</lvl02skill3text>

If it succeeds, you can’t use this feature on it again. If it fails, it becomes friendly to you and obeys your commands until you use this feature again. 
	Intelligent undead are harder to control in this way. If the target has an Intelligence of 8 or higher, it has advantage on the saving throw.

	You can transmute one nonmagical object — no larger than a 5-foot cube — into another nonmagical object of similar size and mass and of equal or lesser value. You must spend 10 minutes handling the object to transform it.  
 
Panacea: 
	You remove all curses, diseases, and poisons affecting a creature that you touch with the transmuter’s stone. The creature also regains all its hit points.  
 
Restore Life: 
	You cast the raise dead spell on a creature you touch with the transmuter’s stone, without expending a spell slot or needing to have the spell in your spellbook.  
 
Restore Youth:  
	You touch the transmuter’s stone to a willing creature, and that creature’s apparent age is reduced by 3d10 years, to a minimum of 13 years. This effect doesn’t extend the creature’s lifespan.

    <lvl02skill1name>Arcane Tradition: War Magic</lvl02skill1name>
    <lvl02skill1text>A variety of arcane colleges specialize in training wizards for war. The tradition of War Magic blends principles of evocation and abjuration, rather than specializing in either of those schools. It teaches techniques that empower a caster’s spells, while also providing methods for a wizard to bolster their own defenses. 
	Followers of this tradition are known as war mages. They see their magic as both a weapon and armor, a resource superior to any flimsy piece of steel. War mages act fast in battle, using their spells to seize tactical control of a situation. Their spells strike hard, while their defensive skills foil their opponents’ attempts to counterattack. War mages are also adept at turning other spellcasters’ magical energy against them. 
	In great battles, a war mage often works with evokers, abjurers, and other types of wizards. Evokers, in particular, sometimes tease war mages for splitting their attention between offense and defense. A war mage’s typical response: "What good is being able to throw a mighty fireball if I die before I can cast it?"

    <lvl06skill1text>Starting at 6th level,you can store magical energy within yourself to later empower your damaging spells. In its stored form, this energy is called a power surge. 
	You can store a maximum number of power surges equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one). Whenever you finish a long rest, your number of power surges resets to one. Whenever you successfully end a spell with dispel magic or counterspell, you gain one power surge, as you steal magic from the spell you foiled. If you end a short rest with no power surges, you gain one power surge. 
	Once per turn when you deal damage to a creature or object with a wizard spell, you can spend one power surge to deal extra force damage to that target. The extra damage equals half your wizard level.

    <lvl01skill2name>Hunter's Bane</lvl01skill2name>
    <lvl01skill2text>Beginning at 1st level, you have survived the imbibing of the Hunter’s Bane, a poisonous alchemical concoction that alters your life’s blood, forever binding you to the darkness and honing your senses against it. You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track Fey, Fiends, and undead , as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about them. If you are actively tracking one of these creature types, you cannot be surprised by any creatures of that type. You can only be tracking one type of creature at a time. 
 
Upon reaching 11th level, you can flare the internal toxic scars from the ritual, using the pain to give clarity, or promote anger. You can choose to suffer damage equal to a roll of your crimson rite damage die to gain  advantage on a Wisdom (Insight ) check or Charisma (Intimidation) check. 
</lvl01skill2text>
    <lvl01skill3name>Crimson Rite</lvl01skill3name>
    <lvl01skill3text>At 1st level, you learn to invoke a rite of blood magic within your weapon at the cost of your own vitality. Choose to learn one rite from the Primal Rites list below. You cannot change this choice. 
As a bonus action, you imbue a single weapon with the elemental energy of a known rite until your next short or long rest. While active, attacks from this weapon deal an additional 1d4 rite damage of the chosen elemental type. Rite damage is considered  magical. The rite damage die changes as you gain blood hunter levels, as shown in the crimson rite damage die column of the blood hunter table. Should your weapon leave your grip, the rite fades immediately. An active rite on a weapon thrown fades directly after the attack is complete. 
When a crimson rite is activated, you suffer damage equal to your character level, and you reduce your maximum hit points by an amount equal to your character level. These lost maximum hit points return once the rite fades and cannot be restored otherwise. When a rite fades, no hit points are regained as part of the restoring of maximum hit points. 
Crimson rite can be used on multiple weapons, costing additional hit point loss. Most weapons can only be subject to a single rite at any given time. Each end of a polearm or quarterstaff is treated as a separate weapon for the purposes of this feature. A rite can be allowed to fade at any time on your turn (no action required ). 
You gain access to an additional Primal Rite at 6th level and 11th level. You may learn an Esoteric Rite at 14th level.

    <lvl03skill1text>The Order of the Ghostslayer is the oldest and most driven of the orders, having rediscovered the secrets of blood magic and refined them for combat against the scourge of undeath. Ghostslayers seek out and study the moment of death, obsessing over the mysteries of the transition.

    <lvl03skill1name>Blood Order: Order of the Lycan</lvl03skill1name>
    <lvl03skill1text>Of the many terrible curses that plague the realm, few are as ancient or as feared as Lycanthropy. Passed through blood, this affliction seeds a host with the savage strength and hunger for violence of a wild beast. Those that shun the curse spend their lives burying their wild, bestial urges deep inside. However, the power of a rising full moon makes the curse too strong to resist, and the host transforms into a terrifying animal-humanoid hybrid controlled by murderous impulse. Those that embrace the dark nature of their curse learn to harness their bestial gifts, but also succumb to the evil, vicious temperament that drives the beast within. 
The Order of the Lycan is a proud order of blood hunters who undergo “ The Taming”, a ceremonial inflicting of lycanthropy from a senior  member. These hunters then use their abilities to harness the power of the monster they harbor without losing themselves to it. Through intense honing of one’s own willpower, combined with the secrets of the order’s blood magic rituals, members learn to control and unleash their hybrid form for short periods of time. Enhanced physical prowess, unnatural resilience, and razor sharp claws make these warriors a terrible foe to any evil that crosses their path. Yet, no training is perfect, and without care and complete focus, even the greatest of blood hunters can temporarily lose themselves to the bloodlust.

You can revert to your normal form earlier by using an action on your turn. You automatically revert to your normal form if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die. The benefits of this form replace the rules for Lycanthropy within the Monsters Manual. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest. While you are transformed, you gain the following features: 
Feral Might: You gain a bonus to melee damage rolls equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded down). You also have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. 
Resilient Hide. You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons that aren't silvered. While you are not wearing heavy armor, you gain a +1 bonus to your AC. 
Predatory Strikes. Your unarmed strikes are considered a single weapon in regards to your crimson rite feature. You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes. When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike, you can make another unarmed strike as a bonus action. Your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 slashing damage. This die increases to 1d8 at 11th level, and 1d10 at 18th level. 
Cursed Weakness. You have vulnerability to damage from silvered weapons. 
Bloodlust. At the start of your turn, if you’ve taken any damage since the beginning of your last turn, you must make a Wisdom saving throw to maintain control.

On a failed save, you must move directly towards the nearest creature to you and use the Attack action against that creature. If there is more than one possible target, the DM chooses the target. You then regain control for the remainder of your turn. If you are under an effect that prevents you from concentrating (like the Barbarians rage feature), you automatically fail this saving throw.</lvl03skill3text>

Any of the target creatures that can hear you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier) or become frightened of you until the end of your next turn.

A creature that succeeds on this saving throw is immune to this blood curse for the next 24 hours. 
Amplify: This curse can target any number of creatures within 60 feet of you.

    <lvl03skill1text>The process of consuming the Hunters Bane is a painful, scarring, and often fatal experience. Those that survive find themselves irrevocably changed, enhanced. Some found this experience exalting, embracing the ability to alter one’s own physiology through corrupted alchemy. 
Over generations of experimentation, a splinter order of blood hunters began to emerge, one that focused on brewing toxic elixirs to modify their capabilities in battle, altering their blood and, over time become something beyond human. They called themselves the Order of the Mutant. 
</lvl03skill1text>
    <lvl03skill2name>Formulas</lvl03skill2name>
    <lvl03skill2text>You begin to uncover forbidden alchemical formulas that temporarily alter your mental and physical abilities. Beginning at 3rd level, you choose to learn three mutagen formulas. Your formula options are detailed at the end of this order description. You gain an additional formula at 7th level, 11th level. 15th level, and 18th level. Additionally, when you gain a new mutagen formula, you can choose one of the formulas you already know and replace it with another mutagen formula. 
</lvl03skill2text>
    <lvl03skill3name>Mutagen Craft</lvl03skill3name>
    <lvl03skill3text>At 3rd level, you can take a short rest to concoct a single mutagen. Consuming a single mutagen requires a bonus action, and the effects (including side effects) last until you complete a short or long rest to meditate and flush the toxins from your system. Mutagens are designed for your biology. They have no effect on large or larger creatures, and only impart the side effects on other medium or smaller creatures that drink the entire mutagen. 
They are also unstable by nature, losing their potency over time and becoming inert if not swallowed before you finish your next short or long rest. Your body will begin to better utilize the toxins you instill it with as you grow in power and experience. These advancing mutations may be signified by a Mutation score. 
Mutation Score = your blood hunter level divided by 4, rounded up.</lvl03skill3text>

    <source>DM's Guild (Matthew Mercer)</source>
    <multiclass/>
    <lvl03skill1name>Blood Order: Order of the Profane Soul</lvl03skill1name>
    <lvl03skill1text>The magics adopted by the wayward blood hunter prove  formidable against many an evil across the realm. However, the darkest of abominations draw from an ancient well of cruel, unfathomable power. These terrors can control shadows to do their bidding, hide in plain sight among the noblest of nobles, and bend the minds of the most stalwart warrior with but a glance. These fiends are far trickier to hunt, and many lost their lives in pursuit of such wickedness. 
A small sect of blood hunters had finally had enough and delved into this same well of corrupting arcane knowledge, making pacts with lesser evils to better combat the greater. While they may have lost a part of themselves, the power gained far outweighed the price, for even devils now quake when they know they’ve drawn the attention of the Order of the Profane Soul. 
</lvl03skill1text>
    <lvl03skill2name>Otherworldly Patron</lvl03skill2name>
    <lvl03skill2text>At 3rd level, you strike a bargain with an other-worldly being of your choice: the Archfey, the Fiend, or the Great Old One, each detailed on page 109 of the PHB, the Undying on page 139 of the Sword Coast Adventurer’s Guide, and the Hexblade or Celestial on page 54 of Xanathar’s Guide to Everything. Your choice augments some of your order features.

Spell Slots: 
The Profane Soul Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what  the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest. For example, when you are 8th level, you have two 2ndlevel spell slots. To cast the lst-level spell witch bolt, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 2nd-level spell. 
 
Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher: 
	At 3rd level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list.

A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table’s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 11th level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd. or 3rd level. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class and order, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace is with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier 
	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
