    <lvl01skill2name>Magic Item Analysis</lvl01skill2name>
    <lvl01skill2text>Starting at 1st level, your understanding of magic items allows you to analyze and understand their secrets. You know the artificer spells detect magic and identify, and you can cast them as rituals. You don’t need to provide a material component when casting identify with this class feature. 
</lvl01skill2text>
    <lvl01skill3name>Artificer Specialist</lvl01skill3name>
    <lvl01skill3text>At 1st level, you choose the type of Artificer Specialist you are: Alchemist or Gunsmith, both of which are detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 1st level and again at 3rd, 9th, 14th, and 17th level.  
</lvl01skill3text>
    <lvl02skill1name>Tool Expertise</lvl02skill1name>
    <lvl02skill1text>Starting at 2nd level, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses any of the tool proficiencies you gain from this class. 
</lvl02skill1text>
    <lvl02skill2name>Wondrous Invention</lvl02skill2name>
    <lvl02skill2text>At 2nd level, you gain the use of a magic item that you have crafted. Choose the item from the list of 2nd-level items below.  
	Crafting an item is a difficult task. When you gain a magic item from this feature, it reflects long hours of study, tinkering, and experimentation that allowed you to finally complete the item. You are assumed to work on this item in your leisure time and to finish it when you level up.  
	You complete another item of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class: 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th level. The item you choose must be on the list for your current artificer level or a lower level.  
	These magic items are detailed in the Dungeon Master’s Guide.  
 
2nd Level: bag of holding, cap of water breathing, driftglobe, goggles of night, sending stones 
</lvl02skill2text>
    <lvl03skill1name>Spellcasting</lvl03skill1name>
    <lvl03skill1text>As part of your study of magic, you gain the ability to cast spells at 3rd level. The spells you learn are limited in scope, primarily concerned with modifying creatures and objects or creating items.  
 
Spell Slots:  
	The Artificer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.  
 
Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher:  
	You know three 1st-level spells of your choice from the artificer spell list (which appears at the end of this document).  
	The Spells Known column of the Artificer table shows when you learn more artificer spells of your choice from this feature. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots on the Artificer table. 
	You learn an additional spell at 4th, 7th, 8th, 10th, 11th, 13th, 14th, 16th, 19th, and 20th level.  
	Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the artificer spells you know from this feature and replace it with another spell from the artificer spell list. The new spell must also be of a level for which you have spell slots on the Artificer table.  
 
Spellcasting Ability:  
	Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your artificer spells; your understanding of the theory behind magic allows you to wield these spells with superior skill. You use your Intelligence whenever an artificer spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an artificer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.  
 
Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier  
 
Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier 
 
Spellcasting Focus:  
	You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your artificer spells. See chapter 5, “Equipment,” in the Player’s Handbook for various arcane focus options.  
</lvl03skill1text>
    <lvl04skill1name>Ability Score Improvement</lvl04skill1name>
    <lvl04skill1text>When you reach 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 18th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. 
</lvl04skill1text>
    <lvl04skill2name>Infuse Magic</lvl04skill2name>
    <lvl04skill2text>Starting at 4th level, you gain the ability to channel your artificer spells into objects for later use. When you cast an artificer spell with a casting time of 1 action, you can increase its casting time to 1 minute. If you do so and hold a nonmagical item throughout the casting, you expend a spell slot, but none of the spell’s effects occur. Instead, the spell transfers into that item for later use if the item doesn’t already contain a spell from this feature.  
	Any creature holding the item thereafter can use an action to activate the spell if the creature has an Intelligence score of at least 6. The spell is cast using your spellcasting ability, targeting the creature that activates the item. If the spell targets more than one creature, the creature that activates the item selects the additional targets. If the spell has an area of effect, it is centered on the item. If the spell’s range is self, it targets the creature that activates the item.  
	When you infuse a spell in this way, it must be used within 8 hours. After that time, its magic fades and is wasted.  
	You can have a limited number of infused spells at the same time. The number equals your Intelligence modifier. 
</lvl04skill2text>
    <lvl05skill1name>Wondrous Invention (2nd)</lvl05skill1name>
    <lvl05skill1text>You complete another magic item of your choice. The item you choose must be on the list for your current artificer level or a lower level.  
	These magic items are detailed in the Dungeon Master’s Guide.  
 
2nd Level: bag of holding, cap of water breathing, driftglobe, goggles of night, sending stones  
 
5th Level: alchemy jug, helm of comprehending languages, lantern of revealing, ring of swimming, robe of useful items, rope of climbing, wand of magic detection, wand of secrets 
</lvl05skill1text>
    <lvl05skill2name>Superior Attunement (Four Items)</lvl05skill2name>
    <lvl05skill2text>At 5th level, your superior understanding of magic items allows you to master their use. You can now attune to up to four, rather than three, magic items at a time. At 15th level, this limit increases to five magic items. 
</lvl05skill2text>
    <lvl06skill1name>Mechanical Servant</lvl06skill1name>
    <lvl06skill1text>At 6th level, your research and mastery of your craft allow you to produce a mechanical servant. The servant is a construct that obeys your commands without hesitation and functions in combat to protect you. Though magic fuels its creation, the servant is not magical itself. You are assumed to have been working on the servant for quite some time, finally finishing it during a short or long rest after you reach 6th level.  
	Select a Large beast with a challenge rating of 2 or less. The servant uses that beast’s game statistics, but it can look however you like, as long as its form is appropriate for its statistics. It has the following modifications:  
 
• It is a construct instead of a beast.  
 
• It can’t be charmed.  
 
• It is immune to poison damage and the poisoned condition.  
 
• It gains darkvision with a range of 60 feet if it doesn’t have it already.  
 
• It understands the languages you can speak when you create it, but it can’t speak.  
 
• If you are the target of a melee attack and the servant is within 5 feet of the attacker, you can use your reaction to command the servant to respond, using its reaction to make a melee attack against the attacker.  
	The servant obeys your orders to the best of its ability. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own.  
	If the servant is killed, it can be returned to life via normal means, such as with the revivify spell. In addition, over the course of a long rest, you can repair a slain servant if you have access to its body. It returns to life with 1 hit point at the end of the rest. If the servant is beyond recovery, you can build a new one with one week of work (eight hours each day) and 1,000 gp of raw materials.

    <lvl01skill1name>Artificer Specialist: Alchemist</lvl01skill1name>
    <lvl01skill1text>An alchemist is an expert at combining exotic reagents to produce a variety of materials, from healing draughts that can mend a wound in moments to clinging goo that slows creatures down.  
</lvl01skill1text>
    <lvl01skill2name>Alchemist's Satchel (Alchemist)</lvl01skill2name>
    <lvl01skill2text>At 1st level, you craft an Alchemist’s Satchel, a bag of reagents that you use to create a variety of concoctions. The bag and its contents are both magical, and this magic allows you to pull out exactly the right materials you need for your Alchemical Formula options, described below. After you use one of those options, the bag reclaims the materials.  
	If you lose this satchel, you can create a new one over the course of three days of work (eight hours each day) by expending 100 gp worth of leather, glass, and other raw materials. 
</lvl01skill2text>
    <lvl01skill3name>Alchemical Formula (3) (Alchemist)</lvl01skill3name>
    <lvl01skill3text>At 1st level, you learn three Alchemical Formula options: Alchemical Fire, Alchemical Acid, and one other option of your choice. You learn an additional formula of your choice at 3rd, 9th, 14th, and 17th levels.  
	To use any of these options, your Alchemist’s Satchel must be within reach.  
	If an Alchemical Formula option requires a saving throw, the DC is 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier. 
</lvl01skill3text>
    <lvl01skill4name>Alchemical Formula: Alchemical Fire</lvl01skill4name>
    <lvl01skill4text>As an action, you can reach into your Alchemist’s Satchel, pull out a vial of volatile liquid, and hurl the vial at a creature, object, or surface within 30 feet of you (the vial and its contents disappear if you don’t hurl the vial by the end of the current turn). On impact, the vial detonates in a 5-foot radius. Any creature in that area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 fire damage.  
	This formula’s damage increases by 1d6 when you reach certain levels in this class: 4th level (2d6), 7th level (3d6), 10th level (4d6), 13th level (5d6), 16th level (6d6), and 19th level (7d6). 
</lvl01skill4text>
    <lvl01skill5name>Alchemical Formula: Alchemical Acid</lvl01skill5name>
    <lvl01skill5text>As an action, you can reach into your Alchemist’s Satchel, pull out a vial of acid, and hurl the vial at a creature or object within 30 feet of you (the vial and its contents disappear if you don’t hurl the vial by the end of the current turn). The vial shatters on impact. A creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 acid damage. An object automatically takes that damage, and the damage is maximized.  
	This formula’s damage increases by 1d6 when you reach certain levels in this class: 3rd level (2d6), 5th level (3d6), 7th level (4d6), 9th level (5d6), 11th level (6d6), 13th level (7d6), 15th level (8d6), 17th level (9d6), and 19th level (10d6). 
</lvl01skill5text>
    <lvl01skill6name>Alchemical Formula: Healing Draught</lvl01skill6name>
    <lvl01skill6text>As an action, you can reach into your Alchemist’s Satchel and pull out a vial of healing liquid. A creature can drink it as an action to regain 1d8 hit points. The vial then disappears. Once a creature regains hit points from this alchemical formula, the creature can’t do so again until it finishes a long rest. If not used, the vial and its contents disappear after 1 hour. While the vial exists, you can’t use this formula.  
	This formula’s healing increases by 1d8 when you reach certain levels in this class: 3rd level (2d8), 5th level (3d8), 7th level (4d8), 9th level (5d8), 11th level (6d8), 13th level (7d8), 15th level (8d8), 17th level (9d8), and 19th level (10d8). 
</lvl01skill6text>
    <lvl01skill7name>Alchemical Formula: Smoke Stick</lvl01skill7name>
    <lvl01skill7text>As an action, you can reach into your Alchemist’s Satchel and pull out a stick that produces a thick plume of smoke. You can hold on to the stick or throw it to a point up to 30 feet away as part of the action used to produce it. The area in a 10-foot radius around the stick is filled with thick smoke that blocks vision, including darkvision. The stick and smoke persist for 1 minute and then disappear. After using this formula, you can’t do so again for 1 minute. 
</lvl01skill7text>
    <lvl01skill8name>Alchemical Formula: Swift Step Draught</lvl01skill8name>
    <lvl01skill8text>As a bonus action, you can reach into your Alchemist’s Satchel and pull out a vial filled with a bubbling, brown liquid. As an action, a creature can drink it. Doing so increases the creature’s speed by 20 feet for 1 minute, and the vial disappears. If not used, the vial and its contents disappear after 1 minute. After using this formula, you can’t do so again for 1 minute. 
</lvl01skill8text>
    <lvl01skill9name>Alchemical Formula: Tanglefoot Bag </lvl01skill9name>
    <lvl01skill9text>As an action, you can reach into your Alchemist’s Satchel and pull out a bag filled with writhing, sticky black tar and hurl it at a point on the ground within 30 feet of you (the bag and its contents disappear if you don’t hurl the bag by the end of the current turn). The bag bursts on impact and covers the ground in a 5-foot radius with sticky goo. That area becomes difficult terrain for 1 minute, and any creature that starts its turn on the ground in that area has its speed halved for that turn. After using this formula, you can’t do so again for 1 minute. 
</lvl01skill9text>
    <lvl01skill10name>Alchemical Formula: Thunderstone</lvl01skill10name>
    <lvl01skill10text>As an action, you can reach into your Alchemist’s Satchel and pull out a crystalline shard and hurl it at a creature, object, or surface within 30 feet of you (the shard disappears if you don’t hurl it by the end of the current turn). The shard shatters on impact with a blast of concussive energy. Each creature within 10 feet of the point of impact must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be knocked prone and pushed 10 feet away from that point. 
</lvl01skill10text>

    <lvl01skill3text>At 1st level, you forge a deadly firearm using a combination of arcane magic and your knowledge of engineering and metallurgy. This firearm is called a Thunder Cannon. It is a ferocious weapon that fires leaden bullets that can punch through armor with ease. You are proficient with the Thunder Cannon. The firearm is a two-handed ranged weapon that deals 2d6 piercing damage. Its normal range is 150 feet, and its maximum range if 500 feet. Once fired, it must be reloaded as a bonus action.  
	If you lose your Thunder Cannon, you can create a new one over the course of three days of work (eight hours each day) by expending 100 gp worth of metal and other raw materials.

    <lvl09skill1text>Starting at 9th level, you can channel force energy into your Thunder Cannon. As an action, you can make a special attack with it. Rather than making an attack roll, you unleash force energy in a 15-foot cone from the gun. Each creature in that area must make a Strength saving throw with a DC of 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier. On a failed saving throw, a target takes 2d6 force damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you.

    <lvl01skill2text>In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action. 
	While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren’t wearing heavy armor. 
 
• You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. 
 
• When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a barbarian. At 1st level, you have a +2 bonus to damage. Your bonus increases to +3 at 9th level and to +4 at 16th. 
 
• You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. 
 
	If you are able to cast spells, you can’t cast them or concentrate on them while raging. 
	Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven’t attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action. 
	Once you have raged the maximum number of times for your barbarian level, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again. You may rage 2 times at 1st level, 3 at 3rd, 4 at 6th, 5 at 12th, and 6 at 17th.

    <lvl02skill1name>Reckless Attack</lvl02skill1name>
    <lvl02skill1text>Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation.

Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn. 
</lvl02skill1text>
    <lvl02skill2name>Danger Sense</lvl02skill2name>
    <lvl02skill2text>At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren’t as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger.

    <lvl03skill1name>Primal Path: Path of the Ancestral Guardian</lvl03skill1name>
    <lvl03skill1text>Some barbarians hail from cultures that revere their ancestors. These tribes teach that the warriors of the past linger on in the world as mighty spirits, who can guide and protect the living. When barbarians who follow this path rage, they cross the barrier into the spirit world and call on these guardian spirits for aid. 
	Barbarians who draw on their ancestral guardians fight to protect their tribes and their allies. With the spirits’ help, they can hinder their foes even as they strike powerful blows against them. In order to cement ties to their ancestral guardians, barbarians who follow this path cover themselves in elaborate tattoos that celebrate their ancestors’ deeds. These tattoos tell epic sagas of victories against terrible monsters and other fearsome rivals. 
</lvl03skill1text>
    <lvl03skill2name>Ancestral Protectors (Path of the Ancestral Guardian)</lvl03skill2name>
    <lvl03skill2text>Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, spectral warriors appear when you enter your rage. While you’re raging, the first creature you hit with an attack on your turn becomes the target of the warriors, which hinder its attacks. Until the start of your next turn, that target has disadvantage on any attack roll that isn’t against you, and when the target hits a creature other than you with an attack, that creature has resistance to the damage dealt by the attack. The ffect on the target ends early if your rage ends.

    <lvl06skill1name>Spirit Shield (Path of the Ancestral Guardian)</lvl06skill1name>
    <lvl06skill1text>Beginning at 6th level, the guardian spirits that aid you can provide supernatural protection to those you defend. If you are raging and a creature you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to reduce that damage by 2d6. 
	When you reach certain levels in this class, you can reduce the damage by more: by 3d6 at 10th level and by 4d6 at 14th level.

    <lvl10skill1name>Consult the Spirits (Path of the Ancestral Guardian)</lvl10skill1name>
    <lvl10skill1text>At 10th level, you gain the ability to consult with your ancestral spirits. When you do so, you cast theaugury or clairvoyance spell, without using a spell slot or material components. Rather than creating a spherical sensor, this use of clairvoyance invisibly summons one of your ancestral spirits to the chosen location. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells. 
	After you cast either spell in this way, you can’t use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.

    <lvl03skill1name>Primal Path: Path of the Berserker</lvl03skill1name>
    <lvl03skill1text>For some barbarians, rage is a means to an end — that end being violence. The Path of the Berserker is a path of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter the berserker’s rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well-being.

    <lvl03skill2name>Frenzy (Path of the Berserker)</lvl03skill2name>
    <lvl03skill2text>Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can go into a frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for the duration of your rage you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns after this one. When your rage ends, you suffer one level of exhaustion. 
 
Exhaustion: 
	Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect's description. 
 
Level — Effect: 
1 —Disadvantage on ability checks 
2 —Speed halved 
3 —Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws 
4 —Hit point maximum halved 
5 —Speed reduced to 0 
6 —Death 
 
	If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect's description. 
	A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks. 
	An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect's description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature's exhaustion level is reduced below 1. 
	Finishing a long rest reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink.

    <lvl10skill1name>Intimidating Presence (Path of the Berserker)</lvl10skill1name>
    <lvl10skill1text>Beginning at 10th level, you can use your action to frighten someone with your menacing presence. When you do so, choose one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more than 60 feet away from you. 
	If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you can’t use this feature on that creature again for 24 hours. 
 
Frightened:

    <lvl03skill1text>All barbarians harbor a fury within. Their rage grants them superior strength, durability, and speed. Barbarians who follow the Path of the Storm Herald learn to transform their rage into a mantle of primal magic, which swirls around them. When in a fury, a barbarian of this path taps into the forces of nature to create powerful magical effects. 
	Storm heralds are typically elite champions who train alongside druids, rangers, and others sworn to protect nature. Other storm heralds hone their craft in elite lodges in regions wracked by storms, in the frozen reaches at the world’s end, or deep in the hottest deserts.

	 Your aura has an effect that activates when you enter your rage, and you can activate the effect again on each of your turns as a bonus action. Choose desert, sea, or tundra. Your aura’s effect depends on that chosen environment, as detailed below. You can change your environment choice whatever you gain a level in this class. 
	 if your aura’s effects require a saving throw, the DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier. 
 
Desert: When this affect is activated, all other creatures your aura take 2 fire damage each. The damage increases when you reach certain levels in his class, increasing to 3 at 5th level, 4 at 10th level, 5 at 15th level, and 6 at 20th level. 
 
Sea: When this effect is activated, you can choose one other creature you can see in your aura. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. The target takes 1d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 2d6 at 10th level, 3d6 at 15th level, and 4d6 at 20th level. 
 
Tundra: When this effect is activated, each creature of your choice in your aura gains 2 temporary hit points, as icy spirits try to inure it to suffering. The temporary hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 3 at 5th level, 4 at 10th level, 5 at 15th level, and 6 at 20th level.

    <lvl14skill1text>At 14th level, the power of the storm you channel grows mightier, lashing out at your foes. The effect is based on the environment you chose for your Storm Aura. 
 
Desert: Immediately after a creature in your aura hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to force that creature to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creaturetakes fire damage equal to half your barbarian level. 
 
Sea: When you hit a creature in your aura with an attack, you can use your reaction to force that creature to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone, as if struck by a wave. 
 
Tundra: Whenever the effect of your Storm Aura is activated, you can choose one creature you can see in the aura. That creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw, or its speed is reduced to 0 until the start of your next turnm as magical frost covers it. 
 
Prone: 
• A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition. 
 
• The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls. 
 
• An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.

For example, if you have a bear totem spirit, you might be unusually hairy and thick-skinned, or if your totem is the eagle, your eyes turn bright yellow.

    <lvl14skill4name>Totemic Attunement: Elk</lvl14skill4name>
    <lvl14skill4text>While raging, you can use a bonus action during your move to pass through the space of a Large or smaller creature.

• The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls. 
 
• An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.

    <lvl03skill1name>Primal Path: Path of the Zealot</lvl03skill1name>
    <lvl03skill1text>Some deities inspire their followers to pitch themselves into a ferocious battle fury. These barbarians are zealots—warriors who channel their rage into powerful displays of divine power. 
	A variety of gods across the worlds of D&amp;D inspire their followers to embrace this path. Tempus from the Forgotten Realms and Hextor and Erythnul of Greyhawk are all prime examples. In general, the gods who inspire zealots are deities of combat, destruction, and violence. Not all are evil, but few are good. 
</lvl03skill1text>
    <lvl03skill2name>Divine Fury (Path of the Zealot)</lvl03skill2name>
    <lvl03skill2text>Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can channel divine fury into your weapon strikes. While you’re raging, the first creature you hit on each of your turns with a weapon attack takes extra damage equal to 1d6 + half your barbarian level. The extra damage is necrotic or radiant; you choose the type of damage when you gain this feature. 
</lvl03skill2text>
    <lvl03skill3name>Warrior of the Gods (Path of the Zealot)</lvl03skill3name>
    <lvl03skill3text>At 3rd level, your soul is marked for endless battle. If a spell, such as raise dead, has the sole effect of restoring you to life (but not undeath), the caster doesn’t need material components to cast the spell on you.

    <lvl06skill1name>Fanatical Focus (Path of the Zealot)</lvl06skill1name>
    <lvl06skill1text>Starting at 6th level, the divine power that fuels your rage can protect you. If you fail a saving throw while you’re raging, you can reroll it, and you must use the new roll. You can use this ability only once per rage.

    <lvl10skill1name>Zealous Presence (Path of the Zealot)</lvl10skill1name>
    <lvl10skill1text>At 10th level, you learn to channel divine power to inspire zealotry in others.

	Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

    <lvl14skill1text>Beginning at 14th level, the divine power that fuels your rage allows you to shrug off fatal blows. 
	While you’re raging, having 0 hit points doesn’t knock you unconscious. You still must make death saving throws, and you suffer the normal effects of taking damage while at 0 hit points. However, if you would die due to failing death saving throws, you don’t die until your rage ends, and you die then only if you still have 0 hit points..

    <lvl01skill2name>Spellcasting</lvl01skill2name>
    <lvl01skill2text>You have learned to untangle and reshape the fabric of reality in harmony with your wishes and music. Your spells are part of your vast repertoire, magic that you can tune to different situations. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the bard spell list. 
 
Cantrips: 
	You know two cantrips of your choice from the bard spell list. You learn additional bard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, learning a 3rd cantrip at 4th level and a 4th at 10th level. 
 
Spell Slots: 
	The Bard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. 
	For example, if you know the 1st-level spell cure wounds and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast cure wounds using either slot. 
 
Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher: 
	You know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the bard spell list. 
	You learn an additional bard spell of your choice at each level except 12th, 16th, 19th, and 20th. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level. 
	Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the bard spells you know and replace it with another spell from the bard spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots. 
 
Spellcasting Ability: 
	Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard spells. Your magic comes from the heart and soul you pour into the performance of your music or oration. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a bard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. 
	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier 
	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier 
 
Ritual Casting: 
	You can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag. 
 
Spellcasting Focus: 
	You can use a musical instrument (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells. 
</lvl01skill2text>
    <lvl01skill3name>Bardic Inspiration</lvl01skill3name>
    <lvl01skill3text>You can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d6. 
	Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time. 
	You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest. 
	Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level.

    <lvl02skill2name>Song of Rest</lvl02skill2name>
    <lvl02skill2text>Beginning at 2nd level, you can use soothing music or oration to help revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest. If you or any friendly creatures who can hear your performance regain hit points at the end of the short rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points. 
	The extra hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level. 
</lvl02skill2text>

    <lvl03skill1text>The College of Glamour is the home of bards who mastered their craft in the vibrant realm of the Feywild or under the tutelage of someone who dwelled there. Tutored by satyrs, eladrin, and other fey, these bards learn to use their magic to delight and captivate others.  
	The bards of this college are regarded with a mixture of awe and fear. Their performances are the stuff of legend. The bards of this college are so eloquent that a speech or song that one of them performs can cause captors to release the bard unharmed and can lull a furious dragon into complacency. The same magic that allows them to quell beasts can also bend minds. Villainous bards of this college can leech off a community for weeks, abusing their magic to turn their hosts into thralls. Heroic bards of this college instead use this power to gladden the downtrodden and undermine oppressors. 
</lvl03skill1text>
    <lvl03skill2name>Mantle of Inspiration (College of Glamour)</lvl03skill2name>
    <lvl03skill2text>When you join the College of Glamour at 3rd level, you gain the ability to weave a song of fey magic that imbues your allies with vigor and speed.  
	As a bonus action, you can expend a use of Bardic Inspiration to grant yourself a wondrous appearance. When you do so, choose a number of allies you can see and who can see you within 60 feet of you, up to a number equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). Each of them gains 5 temporary hit points. When a creature gains these temporary hit points, it can immediately use its reaction to move up to its speed, without provoking opportunity attacks. 
	The number of temporary hit points increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 8 at 5th level, 11 at 10th level, and 14 at 15th level. 
</lvl03skill2text>
    <lvl03skill3name>Enthralling Performance (College of Glamour)</lvl03skill3name>
    <lvl03skill3text>Starting at 3rd level, you can charge your performance with seductive, fey magic.  
	If you perform for at least 1 minute, you can attempt to inspire wonder in your audience by singing, reciting a poem, or dancing. At the end of the performance, choose a number of humanoids within 60 feet of you who watched and listened to all of it, up to a number equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be charmed by you. While charmed in this way, the target idolizes you, it speaks glowingly of you to anyone who talks to it, and it hinders anyone who opposes you, although it avoids violence unless it was already inclined to fight on your behalf. This effect ends on a target after 1 hour, if it takes any damage, if you attack it, or if it witnesses you attacking or damaging any of its allies.  
	If a target succeeds on its save against this effect, the target has no hint that you tried to charm it.  
	Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest. 
 
Charmed: 
• A charmed creature can't attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects. 
 
• The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature. 
</lvl03skill3text>

    <lvl06skill1text>At 6th level, you gain the ability to cloak yourself in a fey magic that makes others want to serve you. As a bonus action, you cast command, without expending a spell slot, and you take on an appearance of unerthly beauty for 1 minute or until your concentration ends (as if you were concentrating on a spell). During this time, you can cast command as a bonus action on each of your turns, without expending a splell slot. 
	Any creature charmed by you automatically fails its saving throw against the command you cast with this feature. 
	Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

	In addition, as a bonus action, you can assume a magically majestic presence for 1 minute or until you are incapacitated. For the duration, whenever any creature tries to attack you for the first time on a turn, the atatcker must make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, it can’t attack you on this turn, and it must choose a new target for its attack or the attack is wasted. On a successful save, it can attack you on this turn but it has disadvantage on any saving throw it makes against your spells on your next turn. 
	Once you assume this majestic presence, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

    <lvl03skill1text>Bards of the College of Lore know something about most things, collecting bits of knowledge from sources as diverse as scholarly tomes and peasant tales. Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate compositions in royal courts, these bards use their gifts to hold audiences spellbound. When the applause dies down, the audience members might find themselves questioning everything they held to be true, from their faith in the priesthood of the local temple to their loyalty to the king. 
	The loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit of beauty and truth, not in fealty to a monarch or following the tenets of a deity. A noble who keeps such a bard as a herald or advisor knows that the bard would rather be honest than politic. 
	The college’s members gather in libraries and sometimes in actual colleges, complete with classrooms and dormitories, to share their lore with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-important figures of authority.

When a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a damage roll, you can use your reaction to expend one of your uses of Bardic Inspiration, rolling a Bardic Inspiration die and subtracting the number rolled from the creature’s roll. You can choose to use this feature after the creature makes its roll, but before the DM determines whether the attack roll or ability check succeeds or fails, or before the creature deals its damage.

    <lvl03skill1name>Bard College: College of Swords</lvl03skill1name>
    <lvl03skill1text>Bards of the College of Swords are called blades, and they entertain through daring feats of weapon prowess. Blades perform stunts such as sword swallowing, knife throwing and juggling, and mock combats. But though they use their weapons to entertain, they are also highly trained and skilled warriors in their own right. 
	Their talent with weapons inspires many blades to lead double lives. One blade might use a circus troupe as cover for nefarious deeds such as assassination, robbery, and blackmail. Other blades strike at the wicked, bringing justice to bear against the cruel and powerful. Most troupes are happy to accept a blade’s talent for the excitement it adds to a performance, but few entertainers fully trust a blade in their ranks. 
	Blades who abandon lives as entertainers have often run into trouble that makes maintaining their secret activities impossible. A blade caught stealing or engaging in vigilante justice is too great a liability for most troupes. With their weapon skills and magic, these blades either take up work as enforcers for thieves’ guilds or strike out on their own as adventurers.

    <lvl03skill6text>At 3rd level, you learn to perform impressive displays of martial prowess and speed. 
	Whenever you take the Attack action on your turn, your walking speed increases by 10 feet until the end of the turn, and if a weapon attack that you make as partr of this action hits a creature, you can use one of the following Blade Flourish options of your choice. You can use only one Blade Flourish option per turn. 
 
Defensive Flourish: You can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to cause the weapon to deal extra damage to the target you hit. The damage equals the number you roll on the Bardic Inspiration die. You also add the number rolled to your AC until the start of your next turn..  
 
Slashing Flourish: You can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to cause the weapon to deal extra damage to the target you hit and to any other creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of you. The damage equals the number you roll on the Bardic Inspiration die. 
 
Mobile Flourish: You can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to cause the weapon to deal extra damage to the target you hit. The damage equals the number you roll on the Bardic Inspiration die. You can also push the target up to 5 feet away from you, plus a number of feet equal to the number you roll on that die.

    <lvl03skill1name>Bard College: College of Valor</lvl03skill1name>
    <lvl03skill1text>Bards of the College of Valor are daring skalds whose tales keep alive the memory of the great heroes of the past, and thereby inspire a new generation of heroes. These bards gather in mead halls or around great bonfires to sing the deeds of the mighty, both past and present. They travel the land to witness great events firsthand and to ensure that the memory of those events doesn’t pass from the world. With their songs, they inspire others to reach the same heights of accomplishment as the heroes of old.

    <lvl03skill1name>Bard College: College of Whispers</lvl03skill1name>
    <lvl03skill1text>Most folk are happy to welcome a bard into their midst. Bards of the College of Whispers use this to their advantage. They appear to be like any other bard, sharing news, singing songs, and telling tales to the audiences they gather. In truth, the College of Whispers teaches its students that they are wolves among sheep. These bards use their knowledge and magic to uncover secrets and turn them against others through extortion and threats.  
	Many other bards hate the College of Whispers, viewing it as a parasite that uses the bards’ reputation to acquire wealth and power. For this reason, members of this college rarely reveal their true nature. They typically claim to follow some other college, or they keep their actual calling secret in order to infiltrate and exploit royal courts and other settings of power.

	The psychic damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 3d6 at 5th level, 5d6 at 10th level, and 8d6 at 15th level.

    <lvl03skill3text>At 3rd level, you learn to infuse innocent-seeming words with an insidious magic that can inspire terror. 
	If you speak to a humanoid alone for at least 1 minute, you can attempt to seed paranoia in its mind. At the end of the conversation, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be frightened of you or another creature of your choice. The target is frightened in this way for one hour, until it is attacked or damaged, or until it witnesses its allies being attacked or damaged. 
	If the target succeeds on its save, the target has no hint that you tried to frighten it. 
	Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short rest or long rest.

	You can use the shadow as an action. When you do so, it vanishes, magically tranforming into a disguise that appears on you. You now look like the dead person, but healthy and alive. This diguise lasts for 1 hour or until you end it as a bonus action. 
	While you’re in the disguise, you gain access to all information that the humanoid would freely share with a casual aquaitance. Such information includes general details on itsbackground and personal life, but doesn’t include secrets. The information is enough that you can pass yourself off as the person by drawing on its memories. 
	Another creature can see through this disguise bu succeeding on a Wisdom (Insight) check conetested by your Charisma (Deception) check, You gain a +5 bonus to your check.

    <lvl14skill1name>Shadow Lore (College of Whispers)</lvl14skill1name>
    <lvl14skill1text>At 14th level, you gain the ability to weave dark magic into your words and tap into a creature’s deepest fears.  
	As an action, you magically whisper a phrase that only one creature of your choice within 30 feet of you can hear. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. It automatically succeeds if it doesn’t share a language with you or if it can’t hear you. On a successful saving throw, your whisper sounds like unintelligible mumbling and has no effect.  
	If the target fails its saving throw, it is charmed by you for the next 8 hours or until you or your allies attack it, damage it, or force it to make a saving throw. It interprets the whispers as a description of its most mortifying secret. You gain no knowledge of this secret, but the target is convinced you know it.  
	The charmed creature obeys your commands for fear that you will reveal its secret. It won’t risk its life for you or fight for you, unless it was already inclined to do so. It grants you favors and gifts it would offer to a close friend.  
	When the effect ends, the creature has no understanding of why it held you in such fear. 
	Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

• A charmed creature can't attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects.
