				<text>	 </text>
				<text>&#8226; You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.</text>
				<text>	 </text>
				<text>	If you are able to cast spells, you can&#8217;t cast them or concentrate on them while raging.</text>

				<text>	Once you have raged the maximum number of times for your barbarian level, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again. You may rage 2 times at 1st level, 3 at 3rd, 4 at 6th, 5 at 12th, and 6 at 17th.</text>

				<name>Relentless Rage</name>
				<text>Starting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points while you&#8217;re raging and don&#8217;t die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead.</text>
